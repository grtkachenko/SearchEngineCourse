      <p n="21">(3) The proposals have been assessed according to the selection and awarding criteria set out in the above call for projects. The projects, the bodies responsible for the carrying out of tests and the eligible costs as well as the maximum Community financial contribution corresponding to 80 % of the eligible costs should be established.</p>
      <p n="22">(4) Community comparative trials and tests should be carried out in the years 2004 and 2005 on seeds and propagating material harvested in 2003, and the details of such trials and tests, the eligible costs as well as the maximum Community financial contribution should also be set out yearly by an agreement signed by the authorising officer of the Commission and the body responsible for the carrying-out of trials.</p>
      <p n="23">(5) For Community comparative trials and tests lasting more than one year, the parts of the trials and tests following the first year should be authorised by the Commission without further reference to the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry, on condition that the necessary appropriations are available.</p>
      <p n="24">(6) Adequate representativity of the samples included in the trials and tests should be ensured, at least for certain selected plants.</p>
      <p n="25">(7) Member States should participate in the Community comparative trials and tests, in so far as seeds of the plants concerned are usually reproduced or marketed in their territories, in order to ensure that proper conclusions may be drawn therefrom.</p>
