      <p n="3">of 19 February 2004</p>

      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed(1), as last amended by Directive 2003/61/EC(2), and in particular Article 17, paragraph 1 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Pursuant to Commission Decision 2004/130/EC(3), the marketing in the Community of seed of spring field beans which does not satisfy the minimum germination requirements laid down in Directive 66/401/EEC was authorised in accordance with defined terms and subject to certain conditions for a period expiring on 15 February 2004.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) The period left to market seed at the less stringent germination requirements, until 15 February 2004, will be insufficient.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Consequently, the authorisation should be extended and Decision 2004/130/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">In Article 1 of Decision 2004/130/EC the date "15 February 2004" is replaced by the date "31 March 2004".</p>
