      <head n="1">2004/100/EC: Council Decision of 26 January 2004 establishing a Community action programme to promote active European citizenship (civic participation)</head>
      <p n="2">Council Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 26 January 2004</p>
      <p n="4">establishing a Community action programme to promote active European citizenship (civic participation)</p>
      <p n="5">(2004/100/EC)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(1),</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) The Treaty establishes citizenship of the Union, which complements and does not replace national citizenship, and which is to be promoted with due regard for subsidiarity.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) The Community and the Member States have as their objectives the promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions, proper social protection, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion.</p>
      <p n="13">(3) Effective and uniform application of Community law is a new priority, which is indispensable to the proper functioning of the internal market. The Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 stressed that an area of freedom, security and justice should be based on the principles of transparency and democratic control, involving an open dialogue with civil society on the aims and principles of this area. The Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union promotes exchanges of views and experience on these matters and coordinates and relays to the public the judicial decisions of the Councils of State with regard to Community law.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) The European Parliament, in its resolution of 15 April 1988(2), considered it desirable that a major effort be undertaken to step up contacts between citizens of different Member States and stated that specific support from the Community institutions for the development of twinning schemes between communes or towns in different Member States is both rational and desirable.</p>
      <p n="15">(5) The European Council of Nice in December 2000, in its Declaration 23, recognised the need to improve and to monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union and its institutions, in order to bring them closer to the citizens of the Member States. The social policy agenda adopted at Nice is based on a new form of governance underlining the role of civil dialogue as an essential part in promoting cooperation with civil society. The agenda provides that the non-governmental organisations, such as the Platform of European social non-governmental organisations, are closely associated with the development of inclusive policies and equal opportunities for all.</p>
      <p n="16">(6) The Laeken Declaration annexed to the Conclusions of the European Council of 14 and 15 December 2001 asserts that one of the basic challenges to be resolved by the European Union is how to bring citizens closer to the European design and the European institutions.</p>
      <p n="17">(7) Headings A-321, A-3020, A-3021, A-3024, A-3026, A-3036 and B3-305 of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2003 and previous financial years have proved their worth in promoting a sustained dialogue with civil society organisations and municipalities on the building of Europe.</p>
      <p n="18">(8) The Council reaffirms its belief in the need to continue supporting town-twinning schemes, given the important role that they can play in promoting civic identity and mutual understanding between the people of Europe. It stresses that, in the context of the multiannual programme, an appropriate budget for, and continued promotion of, town-twinning schemes should be guaranteed, as the European Parliament has insisted every year in the budgetary procedure. It further stresses that it is essential to make the application procedure for, and administration of, town-twinning schemes comprehensible and bring them closer to the citizens.</p>
      <p n="19">(9) The "Our Europe" Association takes the form of a think tank of personalities representative of European society and the political, social, economic and scientific worlds to act as a marketplace for ideas promoting a closer European Union; as such, it pursues an aim of general European interest.</p>
      <p n="20">(10) The Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman houses are meeting places for the people of Europe, the aim being to set the pioneers and pioneering activities of European integration in the context in which two of the founding fathers of Europe lived and worked, and to provide information on today's and tomorrow's Europe; as such, these organisations pursue an aim of general European interest.</p>
      <p n="21">(11) The European Council on Refugees and Exiles represents the organisations of refugees and displaced persons vis-Ã -vis the European Union, promoting the principles and policies contributing to the objectives of the Treaty as regards asylum and combating social exclusion.</p>
      <p n="22">(12) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities(3), hereinafter referred to as "the Financial Regulation", requires a basic act to be provided to cover these existing support actions.</p>
      <p n="23">(13) The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission undertook, at the time of the adoption of the Financial Regulation, to achieve the objective of ensuring that this basic act enters into force as from the financial year 2004. The Commission undertook to take into account the remarks entered in the budget in the context of implementation.</p>
      <p n="24">(14) The Interinstitutional Declaration of 24 November 2003 on the basic acts for grants of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission provides, on an exceptional basis, for transitional clauses concerning the period of eligibility of expenditure to be introduced in this programme.</p>
      <p n="25">(15) This Interinstitutional Declaration also provides for transitional measures for grants under part 2 of the programme to be introduced for the years 2004 and 2005.</p>
      <p n="26">(16) Provision should be made for the geographic coverage of the programme to extend to the acceding Member States, and possibly, in the case of certain actions, to the EFTA/EEA countries and the candidate countries.</p>
      <p n="27">(17) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(4), is included in this Decision for the entire duration of the programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty.</p>
      <p n="28">(18) Any non-Community financing from State resources must comply with Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p n="29">(19) Entities whose actions are not compatible with the objectives of the European Union and its Member States in the areas of public order and public security should be excluded from the benefits of this programme.</p>
      <p n="30">(20) Any support granted pursuant to this Decision should comply strictly with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality,</p>

      <p n="86">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="87">1. Activities supported</p>
      <p n="88">The general objective laid down in Article 1 is to support work in the field of active European citizenship by promoting the actions and operation of the bodies working in this field.</p>
      <p n="89">This support takes the form of one of two types of grant:</p>
      <p n="90">- either an operating grant to co-finance expenditure associated with the permanent work programme of a body which pursues an aim of general European interest in the field of active European citizenship or an objective forming part of the European Union's activities in this area (Parts 1 and 2),</p>
      <p n="91">- or a grant to co-finance a specific action in this area (Part 3).</p>
      <p n="92">Actions of civil society bodies and other structures such as municipalities and organisations of such bodies working at European level in the field of active citizenship which may contribute to supporting Community activity and making it more effective are, in particular:</p>
      <p n="93">- multinational cooperation actions at European level,</p>
      <p n="94">- meetings and debates among citizens on themes of European interest, such as the values, objectives, powers, policies and institutions of the European Union,</p>
      <p n="95">- informal reflection, education and training projects,</p>
      <p n="96">- actions promoting citizens' participation and initiative,</p>
      <p n="97">- exchanges between citizens and their organisations,</p>
      <p n="98">- dissemination of information on Community action,</p>
      <p n="99">- preparation, back-up and evaluation of the actions funded.</p>
      <p n="100">The main activities of the Platform of European social NGOs are as follows:</p>
      <p n="101">- helping to shape EU policies on matters of common interest to its members, especially in connection with social rights, EU social policies and programmes and civil dialogue,</p>
      <p n="102">- keeping its members informed of the development of Community policy relevant to them, facilitating the process of dialogue and consultation of its members with the EU institutions and, through its members, relaying these activities at national level,</p>
      <p n="103">- promoting dialogue with other groupings working on issues of common interest (social partners, other European groupings of NGOs, NGOs in the candidate countries, etc.),</p>
      <p n="104">- strengthening social NGOs in the European Union and in the candidate countries, e.g. by exchange of experience, practice and information among the members of the Platform.</p>
      <p n="105">The main activities of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles are as follows:</p>
      <p n="106">- representing the organisations of refugees, asylum seekers and displaced persons vis-Ã -vis the European Union,</p>
      <p n="107">- coordinating the positions of its members vis-Ã -vis the European Union,</p>
      <p n="108">- relaying information on refugees, asylum seekers and displaced persons to the European institutions,</p>
      <p n="109">- relaying information from the European Union to national councils of refugees and non-governmental organisations,</p>
      <p n="110">- contributing to the exchange of information and good practice,</p>
      <p n="111">- engaging in discussion and reflection on refugees, asylum seekers and displaced persons in Europe and on the European Union's action to assist such persons,</p>
      <p n="112">- raising European public awareness through the network of member organisations,</p>
      <p n="113">- promoting participation and initiative on the part of refugees, asylum seekers and displaced persons.</p>
      <p n="114">The purpose of the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union is to facilitate coordination and relay to the public the judicial decisions of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions with regard to Community law and to facilitate the pooling of methods of transposing and implementing European law at national level.</p>
      <p n="115">This programme also covers the Commission's actions relating to the creation, promotion and management of the think tanks operating in the field of active citizenship and European integration and the organisation of related events.</p>
      <p n="116">2. Implementation of the activities supported</p>
      <p n="117">2.1. The activities carried out by the bodies eligible for Community funding under the programme fall within one of the following areas:</p>
      <p n="118">2.1.1. Part 1: permanent work programmes of the following bodies pursuing an aim of general European interest in the field of active European citizenship:</p>
      <p n="119">- "Our Europe" Association,</p>
      <p n="120">- Jean Monnet house,</p>
      <p n="121">- Robert Schuman house,</p>
      <p n="122">- Platform of European social NGOs,</p>
      <p n="123">- European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE),</p>
      <p n="124">- Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="125">2.1.2. Part 2: permanent work programme of a body pursuing an aim of general European interest in the field of active European citizenship or an objective forming part of the European Union's policy in this area.</p>
      <p n="126">This may relate to:</p>
      <p n="127">- a non-profit body working to assist citizens active in these bodies,</p>
      <p n="128">- a European multiplier network of non-profit bodies active in the States participating in the programme and promoting the principles and policies contributing to the objectives in this area,</p>
      <p n="129">- a body pursuing an objective forming part of the European Union's policy in the field of active citizenship,</p>
      <p n="130">An annual operating grant may be awarded to support the conduct of the permanent work programme of such a body.</p>
      <p n="131">2.1.3. Part 3:</p>
      <p n="132">(a) actions in the field of active European citizenship, conducted in particular by non-governmental organisations, associations and federations of European interest or cross-industry trade unions; by way of derogation from Article 114 of the Financial Regulation, cross-industry trade unions participating in the European social dialogue are eligible under this part even if they do not have a legal personality;</p>
      <p n="133">(b) actions to promote town twinning instigated by municipalities, local and regional communities and bodies, local and regional authorities and organisations thereof.</p>
      <p n="134">2.2. Having regard to the quality and quantity of funding applications, the following guidelines shall be taken into account when allocating the programme's resources:</p>
      <p n="135">- resources to be committed under Part 3a shall not be less than 20 per cent of the annual budget available for this programme,</p>
      <p n="136">- resources to be committed under Part 3b shall not be less than 40 per cent of the annual budget available for this programme.</p>
      <p n="137">3. Selection of beneficiaries</p>
      <p n="138">3.1. An operating grant may be awarded directly to bodies working in the field of active European citizenship under Part 1 of the programme upon approval of an appropriate workplan and budget.</p>
      <p n="139">3.2. In order to award the grants under Part 2 of the programme, the Commission shall publish calls for proposals.</p>
      <p n="140">However, in 2004 and 2005, by way of derogation from the first subparagraph, grants may be awarded to the organisations mentioned in the Appendix hereto.</p>
      <p n="141">In all cases, all requirements of the Financial Regulation, its implementing rules and the basic act apply.</p>
      <p n="142">When a call is published, any priorities as to the themes and types of activity contributing to the general objective of the programme may be indicated, and if the activities are of multiannual duration, this may also be stated.</p>
      <p n="143">3.3. Bodies entitled to receive a grant for specific action under Part 3 of the programme will be selected on the basis of calls for proposals. The Commission shall ensure that the call for proposals is "customer friendly" and does not represent an insurmountable bureaucratic burden. Wherever appropriate, the call for proposals shall be organised in two steps with the first step requiring only the submission of limited documentation strictly necessary for the assessment of the proposal. As regards cross-industry trade unions participating in the European social dialogue, the call for proposals may take the form of a restricted invitation.</p>
      <p n="144">4. Criteria for the assessment of funding applications</p>
      <p n="145">Funding applications shall be assessed in the light of:</p>
      <p n="146">- consistency with the programme objectives,</p>
      <p n="147">- quality of the planned activities,</p>
      <p n="148">- likely multiplier effect on the public of these activities,</p>
      <p n="149">- geographic impact of the activities carried out,</p>
      <p n="150">- citizen involvement in the organisation of the bodies concerned,</p>
      <p n="151">- cost/benefit ratio of the activity proposed(1).</p>
      <p n="152">5. Funding and eligible expenditure</p>
      <p n="153">5.1. Under Part 1, the eligible expenditure of the bodies in question comprises operating costs and expenses for carrying out their actions.</p>
      <p n="154">5.2. Grants to these bodies shall not fund all their eligible expenditure in the calendar year for which they are awarded: at least 10 per cent of the bodies' budgets must be co-financed from non-Community sources. Such co-financing may be partly contributed in kind, provided the contribution is valued at no more than the cost actually incurred and evidenced by accounting documents or the cost generally obtaining on the market in question.</p>
      <p n="155">5.3. Pursuant to Article 113(2) of the Financial Regulation, the principle of gradual reduction shall not apply to operating grants to these bodies, since they are bodies pursuing an objective of general European interest.</p>
      <p n="156">5.4. Under Part 2, the only costs to be taken into account in determining the operating grant shall be those necessary for the proper conduct of the normal activities of the body selected, in particular personnel costs, overheads (rental and property charges, equipment, office supplies, telecommunications, postal charges, etc.), costs of internal meetings, publication, information and dissemination costs and costs directly linked to the body's activities.</p>
      <p n="157">5.5. An operating grant under Part 2 shall not fund all the body's eligible expenditure in the calendar year for which it is awarded. At least 20 per cent of the budgets of the bodies covered by this part must be co-financed from non-Community sources. Such co-financing may be partly contributed in kind, provided the contribution is valued at no more than the cost actually incurred and evidenced by accounting documents or the cost generally obtaining on the market in question.</p>
      <p n="158">5.6. Pursuant to Article 113(2) of the Financial Regulation, operating grants so awarded, if renewed, shall be gradually decreased. This reduction shall apply from the third year onwards, at a rate of 2,5 per cent per year. In order to observe this rule, which applies without prejudice to the co-financing rule mentioned above, the percentage of Community co-financing corresponding to the grant awarded for a given financial year shall be at least 2,5 points below the percentage of Community co-financing corresponding to the grant awarded for the previous financial year.</p>
      <p n="159">5.7. For the award of grants under Part 3, fixed rates may be applied for organisation costs and travel expenses.</p>
      <p n="160">6. Management of the programme</p>
      <p n="161">In the light of a cost/benefit analysis, the Commission may decide to entrust all or part of the tasks of managing the programme to an executive agency, in accordance with Article 55 of the Financial Regulation; it may also have recourse to experts and incur any other expenditure on technical and administrative assistance, not involving the exercise of public authority, outsourced under ad hoc service contracts. It may also finance studies and organise meetings of experts likely to facilitate the implementation of the programme, and undertake information, publication and dissemination actions directly linked to the achievement of the programme's objective.</p>
