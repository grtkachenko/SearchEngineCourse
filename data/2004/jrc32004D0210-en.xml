      <head n="1">2004/210/EC: Commission Decision of 3 March 2004 setting up Scientific Committees in the field of consumer safety, public health and the environment (Text with EEA relevance)</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 3 March 2004</p>
      <p n="4">setting up Scientific Committees in the field of consumer safety, public health and the environment</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">(2004/210/EC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 152 and 153 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) The Scientific Committees were established by Commission Decision 97/404/EC of 10 June 1997 setting up a Scientific Steering Committee(1) and by Commission Decision 97/579/EC of 23 July 1997 setting up Scientific Committees in the field of consumer health and food safety(2).</p>
      <p n="11">(2) The responsibilities of the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) in relation to scientific advice on bovine spongiform encephalophathy and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies have been transferred to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down the procedures in matters of food safety(3).</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Also the responsibilities of five of the eight Scientific Committees established by Decision 97/579/EC have been transferred to EFSA namely the responsibilities of the Scientific Committee on Food, the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health, and of the Scientific Committee on Plants.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) The terms of office of the members of the remaining three Scientific Committees established by Commission Decision 97/579/EC, namely the Scientific Committees on Cosmetic Products and Non-food Products intended for Consumers, the Scientific Committee on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices and the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment have come to an end. Members of those committees remain in office until they are replaced or their appointments are renewed.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) It is therefore necessary to replace Decision 97/404/EC and Decision 97/579/EC and to repeal these acts.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) Sound and timely scientific advice is an essential requirement for Commission proposals, decisions and policy relating to consumer safety, public health and the environment.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) The advice of the Scientific Committees on matters relating to consumer safety, public health and the environment must be based on the principles of excellence, independence and impartiality, and transparency, as developed in the Commission Communication on "The collection and use of expertise by the Commission: principles and guidelines. Improving the knowledge for better policies"(4).</p>
      <p n="17">(8) It is essential that the Scientific Committees make best use of external expertise in the EU and beyond as may be necessary for a specific question.</p>
      <p n="18">(9) It is timely to reorganise the Scientific Committee advisory structure in the light of operational experience, the establishment of the EFSA and the Commission's future needs for independent scientific advice. Such a structure must provide the flexibility to allow it to advise the Commission on matters falling under established areas of competence as well as on emerging and newly identified health risks and matters not within the competence of other Community risk assessment bodies.</p>
      <p n="19">(10) The need for independent scientific advice both in established and new areas of Community responsibilities falling within the competence of the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-food Products intended for Consumers and the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment is likely to continue to increase.</p>
      <p n="20">(11) The number of requests for scientific advice from the Scientific Committee on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices are too few to justify its continuation as a separate Committee. However, in view of the potential importance of this area and in particular of medical devices, it is necessary to retain the capacity to provide scientific advice through an appropriate Scientific Committee.</p>
      <p n="21">(12) In order to strengthen their scientific coherence, synergisms and a multi-disciplinary approach and at the same time minimise overlapping responsibility, it is necessary to redefine the fields of competence of the Scientific Committees and to ensure systematic and structured coordination.</p>
      <p n="22">(13) It is important that the Commission can take a proactive approach to the early assessment of emerging and other newly identified risks,</p>
      <p n="23">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="24">Article 1</p>
      <p n="25">Scientific Committee advisory structure and fields of competence</p>
