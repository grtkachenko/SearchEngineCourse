      <p n="2">Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Republic of Kazakhstan establishing a double-checking system without quantitative limits in respect of the export of certain steel products from the Republic of Kazakhstan to the European Community</p>
      <p n="3">A. Letter from the European Community</p>
      <p n="4">Sir,</p>
      <p n="5">1. I have the honour to refer to the Agreement between the European Coal and Steel Community and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan on trade in certain steel products concluded on 22 July 2002 . Furthermore, consultations took place with regard to problems concerning certain steel products which fall outside the scope of the abovementioned Agreement.</p>
      <p n="6">2. Following these consultations the Parties hereby agree to establish a double-checking system, without quantitative limits, in respect of certain steel products in order to improve transparency and to avoid possible diversions of trade. The details of the double-checking system are annexed to this letter.</p>
      <p n="7">3. This Exchange of Letters is without prejudice to the application of the relevant provisions of the bilateral agreements on trade and trade-related matters, in particular those relating to anti-dumping and safeguard measures.</p>
      <p n="8">4. Either Party may at any time propose amendments to the Annex or the Appendices thereto, which shall require the mutual consent of the Parties and shall take effect as agreed by them. Should anti-dumping or safeguard investigations be initiated or measures introduced in the European Community concerning a product under the double-checking system, Kazakhstan will decide whether to exclude the product in question from the double-checking system. Such a decision shall not affect the entry into free circulation of the product in question into the Community.</p>
      <p n="9">5. In conclusion, I have the honour to propose that if this letter, the Annex and the Appendices thereto are acceptable to your Government, this letter and your confirmation shall together constitute an agreement between the European Community and Kazakhstan, which shall enter into force on the date of your reply.</p>
      <p n="10">Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration,</p>
      <p n="11">On behalf of the European Community</p>

      <p n="77">4. Since the importer needs to present the original export document when requesting an import document, export documents should, as far as possible, be issued in respect of individual commercial transactions, not global contracts.</p>

      <p n="81">8. The competent authorities of the Community shall be informed immediately of the withdrawal or modification of any export documents already issued and, where relevant, of the basis for such action.</p>
