      <p n="2">Commission Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 10 March 2004</p>
      <p n="4">laying down the transitional measures to be applied by Hungary with regard to veterinary checks on live animals entering Hungary from Romania</p>
      <p n="5">(notified under document number C(2004) 724)</p>
      <p n="6">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="7">(2004/253/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to the Treaty of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC(1), and in particular Article 17b thereof,</p>
      <p n="12">Having regard to the 2003 Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia to the European Union, and to the adjustments to the treaties on which the European Union is founded, and in particular Article 42 thereof,</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="14">(1) Hungary has been granted a transitional period of three years with regard to the regime to be applied at the border with Romania for the veterinary checks on live animals.</p>
      <p n="15">(2) The measures to ensure that all checks provided for in Directive 91/496/EC are carried out by the Hungarian authorities during this period should be defined.</p>
      <p n="16">(3) In view of the continuing negotiations with Romania concerning Romania's accession to the European Union, it is inappropriate to require facilities to be developed at crossing points on the Hungarian-Romanian border to carry out checks on live animals.</p>
      <p n="17">(4) Therefore, during the transitional period, provision should be made for inspections to be carried out at inspection sites near the Hungarian-Romanian border that are linked to crossing points. The implementation of the relevant provisions of Directive 91/496/EEC should be adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <p n="18">(5) Article 53 of the Act of Accession provides that the new Member States are to be considered as having received notification of this Decision upon accession.</p>
      <p n="19">(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>

      <p n="29">Article 3</p>
      <p n="30">Adaptation of veterinary checks</p>

These penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In serious cases, they may include destruction of the animals in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of Directive 91/496/EEC. The Hungarian authorities shall notify those provisions to the Commission by 1 May 2004 at the latest and shall notify it without delay of any subsequent amendment affecting them.</p>

      <p n="48">Article 8</p>
