The numbers of returning holdings per division in Belgium should therefore be introduced in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82(3).</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The development of data delivery and control procedures has made the report on the implementation of the selection plan for returning holdings referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 obsolete. Article 6 and Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 should therefore be deleted.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>

      <p n="18">3. Annex II is deleted.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="21">It shall apply from the 2004 accounting year.</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 7 April 2004.</p>
