      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2004</p>
      <p n="3">of 3 December 2004</p>
      <p n="4">adapting for the first time Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to fertilisers (EDDHSA and triple superphosphate)</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 relating to fertilisers [1], and in particular Articles 31 (1) and (3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 provides that a fertiliser belonging to a type of fertiliser listed in Annex I thereto and complying with the conditions laid down in that Regulation may be designated "EC FERTILISER".</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Among the phosphatic fertilisers listed in table A2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 is Triple superphosphate (TSP) and one of the criteria for its labelling is "phosphorus expressed as P2O5 soluble in neutral ammonium citrate, at least 93 % of the declared content of P2O5 being water soluble".</p>
      <p n="12">(3) The higher the water solubility of the TSP fertiliser, the better is its agronomic efficiency. In the past, European soils were in general deficient in phosphorous and a high minimum value of 93 % water solubility was justified in order to correct this deficiency.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) Today, the situation has changed in that many soils are no longer deficient in phosphorous and while there are soil conditions or crops for which TSP with a minimum of 93 % water solubility is still desirable, TSP with a minimum of 85 % of water solubility will be equally effective for many European soils and crops.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) TSP users should therefore be allowed to choose between a TSP with a minimum water solubility of 85 %, or one with a higher solubility, to suit the local soil and crop requirements. The entry concerning TSP in table A2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) 2003/2003 should be adapted accordingly.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) Sodium salt of EDDHSA and its condensation products (EDDHSA) have been in use, particularly in Spain, France and Italy for 15 years as an organic chelating agent for micro-nutrients. Experience shows that it is an efficient fertilising agent and that it poses no risk to the environment.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) In particular, iron chelated with EDDHSA is used to correct iron shortages and to remedy ferric chlorosis. It is recommended for a large variety of vegetal species, particularly fruit trees such as citrus fruit, apricot, avocado plum and peach; it is also used for grapes, for small bushes and strawberries.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) The elimination of ferric chlorosis and its symptoms ensures green foliage, with good growth and development of the fruit for harvest.</p>
      <p n="18">(9) Concerning the effect on the soil and the environment, EDDHSA undergoes a chemical degradation process in the soil which is relatively slow but which does not create any dangerous substances. Nor does it cause any salinity problems in the soil.</p>
      <p n="19">(10) EDDHSA should therefore be added to the list of authorised organic chelating agents for micro-nutrients in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003.</p>
      <p n="20">(11) Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="21">(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003,</p>
      <p n="22">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="23">Article 1</p>
      <p n="24">Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 2</p>
      <p n="26">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="27">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
