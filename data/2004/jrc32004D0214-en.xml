      <p n="3">of 3 March 2004</p>
      <p n="4">amending Decision 2000/40/EC as regards the period of validity of the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to refrigerators</p>

      <p n="6">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="7">(2004/214/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">After consulting the European Union Eco-labelling Board,</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="13">(1) Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides for the award of an eco-label to a product possessing characteristics, which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects and provides that specific eco-label criteria are to be established according to product groups.</p>
      <p n="14">(2) Commission Decision 2000/40/EC of 16 December 1999 establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to refrigerators(2) will expire on 1 December 2003.</p>
      <p n="15">(3) Following the review of that Decision in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, it is appropriate to prolong the period of validity of those ecological criteria for a period of 12 months, in particular to allow those companies that have been awarded the eco-label to continue using the eco-label at least until the revision of Decision 2000/40/EC is completed.</p>
      <p n="16">(4) Decision 2000/40/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="17">(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee set up under Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,</p>
      <p n="18">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="19">Article 1</p>
      <p n="20">Article 3 of Decision 2000/40/EC is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="21">"Article 3</p>
      <p n="22">The product group definition and the criteria for the product group shall be valid until 1 December 2004. If, however, by that date a new decision establishing the product group definition and the criteria for this product group has not yet been adopted, that period of validity shall end either on 1 December 2005 or on the date of adoption of the new decision, whichever is sooner."</p>
      <p n="23">Article 2</p>
      <p n="24">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="25">Done at Brussels, 3 March 2004.</p>
      <p n="26">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="27">Margot Wallstr√∂m</p>
      <p n="28">Member of the Commission</p>
