      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 41 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Article 33j of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain Regulations(1) provides for specific temporary support to be granted to full-time farmers in Malta. On the basis of the information provided by the Maltese authorities, ceilings must be fixed, within the context of Commission Regulation (EC) No 141/2004(2), for the three types of payment provided for.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Article 33l(2a) and (2b) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 lays down derogations to certain provisions of the measure relating to compliance with the standards laid down Articles 21a, 21b and 21c of that Regulation. Detailed rules should be laid down for the application of these derogations.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) The list of rural development measures in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 141/2004 should moreover be aligned with the list laid down in point 8 of Annex II to the draft Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF).</p>
