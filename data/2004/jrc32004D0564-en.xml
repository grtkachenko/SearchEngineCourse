      <head n="1">2004/564/EC: Commission Decision of 20 July 2004 concerning Community reference laboratories for the epidemiology of zoonoses and for salmonella and national reference laboratories for salmonella (notified under document number C(2004) 2781)(Text with EEA relevance)</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Decision of 20 July 2004 concerning Community reference laboratories for the epidemiology of zoonoses and for salmonella and national reference laboratories for salmonella (notified under document number C(2004) 2781) (Text with EEA relevance) (2004/564/EC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Directive 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC(1), and in particular Article 10(1), (2) and (4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the control of salmonella and other specified food-borne zoonotic agents(2), and in particular Article 11(1), (2) and (4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="8">(1) A Community reference laboratory for the epidemiology of zoonoses and a Community reference laboratory for salmonella were designated under Council Directive 92/117/EEC(3). Directive 2003/99/EC provides for Directive 92/117/EEC to be repealed with effect from 12 June 2004 .</p>
      <p n="9">(2) Pursuant to Directive 2003/99/EC, the European Food Safety Authority is to become responsible for tasks equivalent to those performed by the Community reference laboratory for the epidemiology of zoonoses. However, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new order, it is appropriate to maintain the designation of the current Community reference laboratory for the epidemiology of zoonoses for a limited period. That laboratory should therefore temporarily be re-designated as the Community reference laboratory for the epidemiology of zoonoses.</p>
      <p n="10">(3) Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules(4), designates the Community reference laboratory for salmonella designated under Directive 92/117/EEC as the Community reference laboratory for the analysis and testing of zoonoses (salmonella) as from 1 January 2006 . Until that date, in order to avoid a situation without such a laboratory in the Community, that laboratory should temporarily be re-designated as the Community reference laboratory for salmonella.</p>
      <p n="11">(4) For financial management purposes, it is appropriate to clarify that the re-designation of the Community reference laboratories referred to above should apply as from the date when Directive 92/117/EEC ceases to have effect.</p>
      <p n="12">(5) It is appropriate to redefine precisely the responsibilities and tasks of the Community reference laboratory for salmonella and of corresponding national reference laboratories within the new regulatory framework established by Directive 2003/99/EC and Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003. The Community reference laboratory for salmonella has developed activities essentially in the area of live poultry and it is not appropriate to amend its work programme for 2004. The new areas of competence for that Community reference laboratory and for the national reference laboratories for salmonella should therefore apply only as from 1 January 2005 .</p>
      <p n="13">(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">The Bundesinstitut f√ºr Risikobewertung, Berlin, Germany, is designated as the Community reference laboratory for the epidemiology of zoonoses until 31 December 2004 .</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">1. The Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, Bilthoven, Netherlands, is designated as the Community reference laboratory for salmonella until 31 December 2005 .</p>
      <p n="19">2. The responsibilities and tasks of the Community reference laboratory referred to in paragraph 1 are laid down in Annex I. They shall apply with regard to areas other than live poultry as from 1 January 2005 .</p>
      <p n="20">Article 3</p>
      <p n="21">The responsibilities and tasks of the national reference laboratories for salmonella are laid down in Annex II. They shall apply with regard to areas other than live poultry as from 1 January 2005 .</p>
      <p n="22">Article 4</p>
      <p n="23">This Decision shall apply from 12 June 2004 .</p>
      <p n="24">Article 5</p>
