      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 82/894/EEC of 21 December 1982 on the notification of animal diseases within the Community(1) and in particular Article 5 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Commission Decision 2000/807/EC(2) lays down the codified form and the codes for the notification of animal diseases pursuant to Directive 82/894/EEC.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) During the development of their animal disease eradication plans, the Netherlands has adjusted the regions of their country. The boundaries of the new regions have been laid down, so as to make them easier to control in the case of an outbreak. The adjustment of the regions in the Netherlands affects the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) set out in Decision 2000/807/EC. The new regions (compartments) should therefore replace the current ones in the ADNS.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Decision 2000/807/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) In order to protect confidentiality of the transmitted information, the Annex to this Decision should not be published.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
      <p n="19">Annex V to Decision 2000/807/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2004.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 3</p>
      <p n="23">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="24">Done at Brussels, 6 January 2004.</p>

      <p n="29">(2) OJ L 326, 22.12.2000, p. 80. Decision as amended by Decision 2002/807/EC (OJ L 279, 17.10.2002, p. 50).</p>
