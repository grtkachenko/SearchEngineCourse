      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>

      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) The transitional provisions for the border inspection posts between the Member States and the new Member States which are due to be abolished on accession are not made sufficiently clear in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 282/2004 introducing a document for the declaration of, and veterinary checks on, animals from third countries entering the Community(2) and should be reworded to avoid any ambiguity.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) The common veterinary entry document (CVED) in Regulation (EC) No 282/2004 is imprecise as regards the declarations by the person responsible for the load in box 25 and the official veterinarian in box 42 and that document should be reworded.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) To clarify all these points, Regulation (EC) No 282/2004 should be amended accordingly.</p>

      <p n="18">"Article 8</p>
      <p n="19">Until 1 May 2004 this Regulation shall not apply to the border inspection posts listed in Annex II which are due to be abolished upon the accession of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia.";</p>
      <p n="20">2. the model common veterinary entry document in Annex I is replaced by the model in the Annex hereto.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall enter into force on 31 March 2004.</p>
      <p n="23">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
