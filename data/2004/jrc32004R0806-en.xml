      <head n="1">Regulation (EC) No 806/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on promoting gender equality in development cooperation</head>
      <p n="2">Regulation (EC) No 806/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 21 April 2004</p>
      <p n="4">on promoting gender equality in development cooperation</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 179 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="8">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(1),</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) The United Nations Millennium Development Goals call for gender equality and empowerment of women, setting clear targets in the field of education that have to be achieved no later than 2015.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Two-thirds of children out of school are girls. Enrolment rates for girls are still lower than those for boys and drop-out rates for girls are higher.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Article 3(2) of the Treaty stipulates that in all the activities referred to therein, including a policy in the sphere of development cooperation, the Community is to aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) A disproportionate majority of the world's poor are women. Therefore, the promotion of gender equality is important for the overarching goal of poverty reduction by 2015.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) Gender equality of women and men of all ages is recognised as being important to effective and efficient work against poverty. To achieve the goal of gender equality through the gender mainstreaming strategy, there is a need to combine it with specific measures in favour of women of all ages.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) Women's contribution to development is achieved in the face of numerous obstacles, limiting the outcome of their work and reducing the benefits for themselves and to society as a whole. The importance of women's economic, social, and environmental roles across the life course, in developing countries has led to increasing international recognition that their full participation without discrimination is indispensable for sustainable and effective development.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) The Community and its Member States were signatories to the Declaration and Platform for Action of the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, which stressed the need for action against world-wide obstacles to gender equality and established gender mainstreaming as a strategy to promote gender equality.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) The United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women considers discrimination against women as an obstacle to development, and the parties to the Convention agree to eliminate this discrimination using all appropriate means.</p>
      <p n="18">(9) Council Regulation (EC) No 2836/98 of 22 December 1998 on integrating of gender issues in development cooperation(2) aims to support the mainstreaming of gender analysis in all area of development cooperation policies and to support and facilitate the inclusions of actions addressing major gender disparities. It ensures that gender equality is promoted in national plans designed to implement major elements of the Beijing Platform for Action. That Regulation expired on 31 December 2003.</p>
      <p n="19">(10) The Declaration by the Council and the Commission on the European Community's development policy, adopted on 10 November 2000, states that gender equality is a cross-cutting issue.</p>
      <p n="20">(11) The Commission's Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 21 June 2001 on the Programme of Action on the mainstreaming of gender equality in Community development cooperation sets the implementation framework for that mainstreaming. That programme of action was endorsed by the Council in its Conclusions of 8 November 2001.</p>
      <p n="21">(12) The European Parliament stressed in its Resolution of 25 April 2002(3)1 on that programme of action its commitment to gender mainstreaming as the approach to furthering the goal of gender equality and improving the position of women in developing countries.</p>
      <p n="22">(13) This Regulation lays down, for the entire duration of the programme, a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(4), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure. In general, EC development-related funding should also contribute towards gender equality as a cross-cutting issue.</p>
      <p n="23">(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).</p>
      <p n="24">(15) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely to promote gender equality in development cooperation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of that action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,</p>
      <p n="25">HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="26">CHAPTER I</p>
      <p n="27">SCOPE</p>

      <p n="44">(c) supporting awareness-raising and advocacy work and the establishment of stakeholders' networks in the field of gender equality;</p>
      <p n="45">(d) supporting activities aiming at strengthening institutional and operational capacities of key stakeholders in partner countries in the development process, such as the provision of gender specialists, training and technical assistance.</p>
      <p n="46">2. The instruments to be financed in the course of the activities referred to in paragraph 1 may take the form of:</p>
      <p n="47">(a) methodological and organisational studies on gender mainstreaming relevant to all age-groups;</p>

      <p n="55">In the selection and implementation of activities referred to in Article 4(1), particular attention shall be paid to:</p>

      <p n="57">(b) strengthening strategic partnerships and initiating transnational cooperation which reinforces, in particular, regional cooperation in the area of gender equality;</p>
      <p n="58">(c) the pursuit of cost-effectiveness and sustainable impact in the design and planning of interventions;</p>
