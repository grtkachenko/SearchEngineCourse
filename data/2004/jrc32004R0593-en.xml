      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 593/2004</p>
      <p n="3">of 30 March 2004</p>
      <p n="4">opening and providing for the administration of the tariff quotas in the egg sector and for egg albumin</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in eggs(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 493/2002(2), and in particular Article 3(2), Article 6(1) and Article 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2783/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common system of trade for ovalbumin and lactalbumin(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2916/95(4), and in particular Article 2(2), Article 4(1) and Article 10 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas,</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1474/95 of 28 June 1995 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas in the egg sector and for egg albumin(5), has been substantially amended several times(6). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said regulation should be codified.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) In the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Community has undertaken to open tariff quotas for certain products in the egg sector and for egg albumin. As a result, detailed rules for the application of those quotas should be laid down.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) The administration of the arrangements should be based on import licences. To that end, the detailed rules for submission of the applications and the information which must appear on the applications and licences, by way of derogation from Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(8), should be laid down. In addition, provision should be made for the licences to be issued after a period of consideration, applying, where necessary, a single percentage of acceptance. It is in the interest of importers and exporters to allow the licence application to be withdrawn after the coefficient of acceptance has been fixed.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) In order to ensure the regularity of imports, the quantity referred to in Annex I should be staggered over one year.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) In order to ensure proper administration of the system, the security for import licences under the said system should be fixed at EUR 20 per 100 kg (shell egg equivalent).</p>
      <p n="15">(6) In order to ensure that the system is working properly and in particular to eliminate the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the egg and albumin sector, precise conditions governing access by traders to the system should be laid down aiming at ensuring the seriousness of their activities in this sector.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) The attention of the operators should be drawn to the fact that licences may only be used for products which comply with all veterinary provisions in force in the Community.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) To ensure sound administration of the import arrangements, the Commission should have at its disposal accurate information provided by the Member States on quantities actually imported. In the interest of clarity, a single model should be used by the Member States for notifying quantities to the Commission.</p>
      <p n="18">(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,</p>
      <p n="19">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="20">Article 1</p>
      <p n="21">The import tariff quotas listed in Annex I are opened annually for the period from 1 July to 30 June for the product groups and under the conditions indicated therein.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 2</p>
      <p n="23">The quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be staggered as follows:</p>
      <p n="24">for group E 1:</p>
      <p n="25">- 20 % in the period from 1 July to 30 September,</p>
      <p n="26">- 30 % in the period from 1 October to 31 December,</p>
      <p n="27">- 30 % in the period from 1 January to 31 March,</p>
      <p n="28">- 20 % in the period from 1 April to 30 June,</p>
      <p n="29">for groups E 2 and E 3:</p>

      <p n="31">- 25 % in the period from 1 October to 31 December,</p>
      <p n="32">- 25 % in the period from 1 January to 31 March,</p>

      <p n="38">(a) applicants for import licences shall be natural or legal persons who, at the time applications are submitted, can prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities in the Member States that they have imported not less than 50 tonnes (shell egg equivalent) of products falling within the scope of Regulations (EEC) No 2771/75 (excluding hatching eggs) and (EEC) No 2783/75 in each of the two calendar years preceding the year in which the licence application is lodged, or who are approved in accordance with Article 6(1) of Council Directive 89/437/EEC(9) for the treatment of egg products. However, retail establishments or restaurants selling their products to final consumers are excluded from the benefits of this system;</p>
      <p n="39">(b) licence applications shall not involve more than one of the groups referred to in Annex I. They may involve several products covered by different CN codes and originating in one single country; in such cases, all the CN codes shall be indicated in section 16 and their descriptions in section 15. Regarding groups E2 and E3, the total quantity shall be converted into shell egg equivalent.</p>

      <p n="69">Where the same applicant submits more than one application relating to products in the same group, all applications from that person shall be inadmissible.</p>

      <p n="76">Operators may withdraw their licence applications within 10 working days following publication of the single percentage of acceptance in the Official Journal of the European Union if application of the percentage results in the fixing of a quantity less than 20 tonnes shell egg equivalent. The Member States shall inform the Commission thereof within five working days following the withdrawal of the licence application and shall release the security immediately.</p>

      <p n="87">However, Article 8(4) of that regulation notwithstanding, the quantity imported in accordance with this Regulation may not exceed that shown in sections 17 and 18 of the import licence. The figure "0" shall accordingly be entered in section 19 of the licence.</p>
