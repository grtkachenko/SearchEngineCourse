      <p n="9">Whereas common wheat of bread-making quality may, therefore, be supplied as food aid;</p>

      <p n="13">Article 1</p>

      <p n="15">"The price at which the intervention agency hands over goods in implementation of the 1971 Food-Aid Convention shall be, as appropriate, the single intervention price or the reference price for the month in which the goods are removed from intervention."</p>
      <p n="16">Article 2</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="18">It shall apply with effect from 1 August 1977.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
