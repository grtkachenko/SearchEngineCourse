      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 352/78 of 20 February 1978 on the crediting of securities, deposits and guarantees furnished under the common agricultural policy and subsequently forfeited</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2788/72 (2), and in particular Article 2 (2) and Article 3 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas under Community regulations numerous securities are required in connection with operations relating to agricultural products ; whereas provision must be made for the crediting of such securities in cases where they are forfeited;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas in most cases where securities are forfeited the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) suffers a financial loss either because it has financed a measure and the operator has failed to meet his obligations or because such failure by the operator subsequently involves the EAGGF in expenditure ; whereas such loss should consequently be remedied by using forfeited securities to reduce EAGGF expenditure;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, however, securities which do not cover a risk of financial loss by the EAGGF should be retained by the Member States;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas securities forfeited in respect of food-aid operations should be used to reduce the food-aid expenditure concerned;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas it is also right that securities forfeited as part of a specific operation should be used to reduce the expenditure relating to that type of operation;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas similar rules already exist in certain sectors ; whereas they should be repealed,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">1. This Regulation shall apply to any security, deposit or guarantee furnished pursuant to provisions adopted under the common agricultural policy (hereinafter referred to as "security").</p>
      <p n="17">2. However, this Regulation shall not apply to any security furnished (a) in connection with the issue of export or import licences with or without advance fixing of amounts;</p>
      <p n="18">(b) under a tendering procedure for the sole purpose of ensuring the submission by tenderers of genuine tenders;</p>
      <p n="19">(c) in order to guarantee payment of a duty constituting part of the Communities' own resources as defined in Decision 70/243/ECSC, EEC, Euratom (4), where the amount of such duty has already been determined pursuant to Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2891/77 (5) and made available to the Commission. (1)OJ No L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 13. (2)OJ No L 295, 30.12.1972, p. 1. (3)OJ No C 125, 8.6.1976, p. 34. (4)OJ No L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 19. (5)OJ No L 336, 27.12.1977, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">1. Any security referred to in Article 1 which is forfeited shall be used in its entirety by the paying authorities or bodies in the Member States to reduce EAGGF expenditure.</p>
      <p n="22">2. However, any security which is forfeited in respect of food-aid operations shall be used by the paying authorities or bodies in the Member States to reduce the food-aid expenditure concerned.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
      <p n="24">1. Any security referred to in Article 2 (1) shall be deducted: (a) from the refunds concerned if the completed or proposed operation in respect of which the security was furnished concerns trade with third countries;</p>
      <p n="25">(b) from the intervention expenditure concerned in all other cases.</p>
      <p n="26">2. If the expenditure chargeable to the EAGGF is supported by accounts, such accounts shall be credited with any security referred to in Article 2 (1).</p>
      <p n="27">Article 4</p>
      <p n="28">Article 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2306/70 of 10 November 1970 on the financing of intervention expenditure in respect of the internal market in milk and milk products (1) and Article 3 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 786/69 of 22 April 1969 on the financing of intervention expenditure in respect of the internal market in oils and fats (2) are hereby repealed.</p>
      <p n="29">Article 5</p>
      <p n="30">Detailed rules for the application of this Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70.</p>
      <p n="31">Article 6</p>
      <p n="32">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="33">It shall apply to any security forfeited from 1 January 1978.</p>
      <p n="34">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="35">Done at Brussels, 20 February 1978.</p>
      <p n="36">For the Council</p>
      <p n="37">The President</p>
