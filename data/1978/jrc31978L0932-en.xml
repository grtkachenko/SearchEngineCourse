      <p n="171">1.1 . SETTING UP</p>
      <p n="172">THE HEAD RESTRAINT MUST BE FITTED AND TESTED ON THE SEAT OF THE VEHICLE FOR WHICH IT IS INTENDED . THE SEAT MUST BE FIRMLY SECURED TO THE TEST BENCH SO THAT IT DOES NOT MOVE UNDER IMPACT .</p>
      <p n="173">1.2 . TEST APPARATUS</p>
      <p n="174">1.2.1 . THIS APPARATUS CONSISTS OF A PENDULUM WHOSE PIVOT IS SUPPORTED BY BALL-BEARINGS AND WHOSE REDUCED MASS ( 1 ) AT ITS CENTRE OF PERCUSSION IS 6 * 8 KG . THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF THE PENDULUM CONSISTS OF A RIGID HEADFORM 165 MM IN DIAMETER WHOSE CENTRE IS IDENTICAL WITH THE CENTRE OF PERCUSSION OF THE PENDULUM .</p>
      <p n="175">1.2.2 . THE HEADFORM IS FITTED WITH TWO ACCELEROMETERS AND A SPEED-MEASURING DEVICE , ALL CAPABLE OF MEASURING VALUES IN THE DIRECTION OF IMPACT .</p>
      <p n="176">1.3 . RECORDING INSTRUMENTS</p>
      <p n="177">THE RECORDING INSTRUMENTS USED MUST BE SUCH THAT MEASUREMENTS CAN BE MADE WITH THE FOLLOWING DEGREES OF ACCURACY :</p>
      <p n="178">1.3.1 . ACCELERATION :</p>
      <p n="179">_ ACCURACY : MORE OR LESS 5 % OF THE REAL VALUE ,</p>
      <p n="180">_ FREQUENCY RESPONSE : UP TO 1 000 HZ</p>
      <p n="181">_ CROSS-AXIS SENSITIVITY : &lt; 5 % OF THE LOWEST POINT ON THE SCALE .</p>
      <p n="182">1.3.2 . SPEED :</p>
      <p n="183">_ ACCURACY : MORE OR LESS 2 * 5 % OF THE REAL VALUE ,</p>
      <p n="184">_ SENSITIVITY : 0 * 5 KM / H .</p>
      <p n="185">1.3.3 . TIME RECORDING :</p>
      <p n="186">_ THE INSTRUMENTATION MUST ENABLE THE ACTION TO BE RECORDED THROUGHOUT ITS DURATION AND READINGS TO BE MADE WITHIN ONE THOUSANDTH OF A SECOND ,</p>
      <p n="187">_ THE BEGINNING OF THE IMPACT AT THE MOMENT OF FIRST CONTACT BETWEEN THE HEADFORM AND THE HEAD RESTRAINT BEING TESTED IS NOTED ON THE RECORDINGS USED FOR ANALYZING THE TEST .</p>
      <p n="188">1.4 . TEST PROCEDURE</p>
      <p n="189">1.4.1 . THE SURFACE TO BE TESTED MUST BE SO PLACED THAT THE PENDULUM WILL STRIKE THE SURFACE PERPENDICULAR TO THE POINT CONCERNED .</p>
      <p n="190">1.4.2 . THE HEADFORM MUST STRIKE THE TEST ITEM AT A SPEED OF 24 * 1 KM / H THIS SPEED IS ACHIEVED EITHER BY THE MERE ENERGY OF PROPULSION OR BY USING AN ADDITIONAL PROPELLING DEVICE .</p>
      <p n="191">2 . RESULTS</p>
      <p n="192">IN TESTS CARRIED OUT BY THE ABOVE PROCEDURE , THE DECELERATION OF THE HEADFORM MUST NOT EXCEED 80 G CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN THREE MILLISECONDS . THE DECELERATION RATE IS TAKEN AS THE AVERAGE OF THE READINGS ON THE TWO DECELEROMETERS .</p>
      <p n="193">3 . EQUIVALENT PROCEDURES</p>
      <p n="194">3.1 . EQUIVALENT TEST PROCEDURES ARE PERMITTED ON CONDITION THAT THE RESULTS REQUIRED IN SECTION 2 CAN BE OBTAINED .</p>
      <p n="195">3.2 . RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEMONSTRATING THE EQUIVALENCE OF A METHOD OTHER THAN THAT DESCRIBED IN SECTION 1 RESTS WITH THE PERSON USING SUCH A METHOD .</p>
      <p n="196">( 1 ) THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE REDUCED MASS " MR " OF THE PENDULUM TO THE TOTAL MASS " M " OF THE PENDULUM AT A DISTANCE " A " BETWEEN THE CENTRE OF PERCUSSION AND THE AXIS OF ROTATION AND AT A DISTANCE " I " BETWEEN THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY AND THE AXIS OF ROTATION IS GIVEN BY THE FORMULA : MR = M I / A .</p>
