      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EEC) No 1562/78 of 29 June 1978 amending Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1562/78 of 29 June 1978 amending Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the purpose of the organization of the market in olive oil is to maintain the level of consumption of that product in the Community, having regard to the competition from other vegetable oils, and to ensure that producers receive a fair income for the quantity of olive oil actually produced;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas experience has shown that the present system of production aid is not consistent with the abovementioned objectives ; whereas it provides for several control measures which, by reason of their complexity and the considerable number of producers concerned, are difficult to apply and lead to considerable delays in the payment of aid;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas in recent years consumption of olive oil in the Community has decreased substantially as a result of the difference in price trends between olive oil and competing oils ; whereas the present system of aid does not appear to be suitable for encouraging consumption of olive oil ; whereas it could, moreover, create other problems at the production stage;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, therefore, a new system should be introduced, providing for the grant of consumption aid to ensure that olive oil is sold at prices which are competitive with the prices of seed oils;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, in order to ensure that the system of consumption aid is administered efficiently, provision should be made to enable the administration of this system of aid to be assigned to a trade organization under the control of the Member State concerned ; whereas, in order to ensure the proper functioning of that organization, provision should be made to enable a levy to be imposed on the beneficiaries of the aid;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, since the abovementioned aid will be restricted to the quantities sold on the Community market, provision must be made for granting production aid at a fixed rate to compensate for restricting consumption aid to the said quantities ; whereas, to avoid structural surpluses, this production aid should be granted only in respect of areas planted with olive trees on the date on which the new system enters into force;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, to assist in achieving a balance between supply and demand, it may be appropriate to take measures to improve the quality of production and to promote sales and consumption ; whereas it should be laid down that the costs incurred as a result of such measures should be borne by producers and the other beneficiaries of such measures;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the production target price and the system of production aid can achieve their aims only if the price at which the producer sells his oil on the market is as close as possible to the production target price minus the abovementioned aid ; whereas stabilizing mechanisms should therefore be provided within the Community;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the desired stability may be obtained by enabling producers or producer groups to offer olive oil to the competent agencies of the Member States ; whereas such possibility should be restricted to these categories so as to prevent imported oil and oil in respect of which consumption aid has been paid from being offered for intervention; (1)OJ No C 108, 8.5.1978, p. 49.</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas, to promote the orderly marketing of Community production, the system of monthly increases should be relaxed ; whereas, to the same end, provision should be made for the adoption of special intervention measures at the end of the marketing year;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1419/78 (2), laid down that a levy was to be charged on imports of olive oil other than untreated, the variable component of which was to be derived from the levy applicable to the quantity of untreated olive oil necessary for its production ; whereas experience has shown that the trend on the world market in oils other than untreated may not be in line with the market trend for untreated oils ; whereas such divergence could lead to disturbances of the Community market ; whereas to remedy this situation provision should be made for the possibility of fixing a levy which takes account of the situation of the market in oil other than untreated;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas the possibility of fixing a special levy for oil other than untreated renders the system of compensatory amounts in respect of such oil no longer necessary;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas, as regards trade with third countries, Council Regulation (EEC) No 2843/76 of 23 November 1976 laying down special measures in particular for the determination of the offers of olive oil on the world market (3) derogated from the system of fixing the levy on the basis of the cif price by providing for the levy to be determined by means of a tendering procedure;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas the difficulties in assessing the true market situation, which were the reason for the adoption of this special system, are liable to recur in the future ; whereas, therefore, provision should be made for the possibility of again having recourse to this system, after suspension of the application of the original system for fixing the levies;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas the volume of international trade in olives and oil cake and other residues is very small compared with trade in olive oils ; whereas, to simplify administration, the system of tendering for the levy should be restricted to imports of olive oil;</p>
      <p n="22">Whereas, to the same end, provision should be made for the possibility of exempting from the application of the said system imports of olive oil having no effect on international trade in that product;</p>
      <p n="23">Whereas the formation of producer groups in the olive oil sector may contribute to the proper functioning of the system of production aid, in particular by the involvement of producers in certain aspects of administering the said system ; whereas, to enable recognized groups to achieve that objective, one of the conditions for recognition should be the obligation for the group to undertake certain operations connected with the application of the system ; whereas, having regard to the tasks assigned to the groups recognized under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/78 of 19 June 1978 on producer groups and associations thereof (4), aid should be granted to their members in proportion to the quantity of oil actually produced by them;</p>
      <p n="24">Whereas, having regard to the characteristics of the market in olive oil and the special tasks assigned to the groups, additional measures should be laid down to facilitate the formulation and operation of such groups;</p>
      <p n="25">Whereas, to ensure greater market stability, provision should be made for the possibility of producer groups concluding storage contracts under certain conditions;</p>
      <p n="26">Whereas, in order to ensure the proper application of the abovementioned systems of aid, Member States should be required to take sanctions in the event of breaches,</p>
      <p n="27">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="96">2. The cif price, calculated for the frontier crossing point referred to in Article 9, shall be determined on the basis of the most favourable purchasing possibilities on the world market, the prices being adjusted by reference to any differences from the description or quality for which the threshold price was fixed.</p>
      <p n="97">3. Where free quotations on the world market are not a determining factor for the offer price and where that price is lower than world market prices, a price determined on the offer price shall be substituted for the cif price in respect of the imports in question only.</p>

      <p n="101">2. Where, for one or more origins, the offer prices on the world market for olive oil falling within subheading 15.07 A II of the Common Customs Tariff are not in line with the cif price referred to in Article 14, the latter shall be replaced for the calculation of the variable component of the levy by a price determined on the basis of the abovementioned offer prices.</p>
