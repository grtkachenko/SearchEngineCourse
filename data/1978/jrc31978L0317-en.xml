      <p n="189">METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE DIMENSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE VEHICLE'S PRIMARY REFERENCE MARKS AND THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL REFERENCE GRID</p>
      <p n="190">1 . RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REFERENCE GRID AND VEHICLE'S PRIMARY REFERENCE MARKS</p>
      <p n="191">TO VERIFY SPECIFIC DIMENSIONS ON OR WITHIN A VEHICLE SUBMITTED FOR TYPE-APPROVAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS DIRECTIVE , THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COORDINATES OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL REFERENCE GRID DEFINED IN 2.3 OF ANNEX I , WHICH HAVE BEEN LAID OUT AT THE INITIAL VEHICLE-DESIGN STAGE , AND THE POSITIONS OF THE PRIMARY REFERENCE MARKS DEFINED IN 2.4 OF ANNEX I , MUST BE ESTABLISHED ACCURATELY SO THAT SPECIFIC POINTS ON THE VEHICLE MANUFACTURER'S DRAWINGS CAN BE LOCATED ON AN ACTUAL VEHICLE PRODUCED FROM THOSE DRAWINGS .</p>
      <p n="192">2 . METHOD FOR ESTABLISHING RELATIONSHIP OF REFERENCE GRID TO REFERENCE MARKS</p>
      <p n="193">FOR THIS PURPOSE , A GROUND REFERENCE PLANE SHALL BE CONSTRUCTED , WHICH IS MARKED WITH THE X-X MEASUREMENT AND THE Y-Y MEASUREMENT . THE METHOD OF ACHIEVING THIS IS SET OUT IN FIGURE 3 OF THIS ANNEX , THE REFERENCE PLANE BEING A HARD , FLAT , LEVEL SURFACE ON WHICH THE VEHICLE STANDS , AND WHICH HAS TWO MEASURING SCALES FIRMLY FIXED TO ITS SURFACE ; THESE SHALL BE GRADUATED IN MILLIMETRES , THE X-X SCALE BEING NOT LESS THAN 8 M LONG , AND THE Y-Y SCALE NOT LESS THAN 4 M LONG . THE TWO SCALES MUST BE SET AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 3 OF THIS ANNEX . THE INTERSECTION OF THE SCALES IS GROUND ZERO .</p>
      <p n="194">3 . EXAMINATION OF THE REFERENCE PLANE</p>
      <p n="195">IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR MINOR VARIATIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE REFERENCE PLANE OR TEST AREA , IT IS NECESSARY TO MEASURE THE DEVIATIONS FROM GROUND ZERO ALONG BOTH THE X AND Y SCALES AT INTERVALS OF 250 MM AND TO RECORD THE READINGS OBTAINED SO THAT CORRECTIONS CAN BE MADE WHEN CHECKING THE VEHICLE .</p>
      <p n="196">4 . ACTUAL TEST ATTITUDE</p>
      <p n="197">IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR MINOR CHANGES IN SUSPENSION HEIGHT , ETC . , IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE AVAILABLE A MEANS OF BRINGING THE PRIMARY REFERENCE MARKS TO THE CORRECT COORDINATE POSITIONS RELATIVE TO THE DESIGN ATTITUDE BEFORE FURTHER MEASUREMENTS ARE TAKEN . IN ADDITION , IT MUST BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE MINOR LATERAL AND/OR LONGITUDINAL ADJUSTMENT TO THE VEHICLE'S POSITION SO AS TO PLACE IT CORRECTLY IN RELATION TO THE REFERENCE GRID .</p>
      <p n="198">5 . RESULTS</p>
      <p n="199">THE VEHICLE HAVING BEEN CORRECTLY PLACED RELATIVE TO THE REFERENCE GRID AND IN ITS DESIGN ATTITUDE , THE SITE OF THE NECESSARY POINTS FOR STUDYING THE FORWARD VISIBILITY REQUIREMENTS CAN BE READILY DETERMINED . TEST METHODS TO DETERMINE THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY INCLUDE THE USE OF THEODOLITES , LIGHT SOURCES OR SHADOW DEVICES , OR ANY OTHER METHOD WHICH CAN BE SHOWN TO GIVE EQUIVALENT RESULTS .</p>
