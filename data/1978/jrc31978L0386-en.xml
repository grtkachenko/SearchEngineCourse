      <p n="6">Whereas, in the light of the development of scientific and technical knowledge, Annexes I, II and III to the Directive should be amended for the set reasons out below;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, in order to improve the genetic value of seeds, provision should be made for varietal purity standards which the crop must satisfy in the case of certain spiecies;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas in this respect, in the case of self-fertilized species and of apomictic uniclonal varieties of Poa spp., provision should be made for varietal purity standards which the seeds must satisfy;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas provision should be made for conditions to be satisfied by the crop as regards the presence of harmful organisms which reduce the usefulness of the seed;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas special standards should be set in respect of the maximum content of further undesiderable or noxious seeds as Agropyron repens, Avena ludoviciana, Avena sterilis, Melilotus spp., Sinapis arvensis, Raphanus raphanistrum or Rumex species other than Rumex acetosella, Rumex crispus and Rumex obtusifolius;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas standards in respect of minimum germination capacity and of minimum analytical purity should be adapted in the light of the development of the seed quality normally achieved;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, in order to satisfy the conditions for official examination of seed carried out in accordance with current international methods, it is necessary to revise certain provisions;</p>
