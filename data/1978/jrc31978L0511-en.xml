      <p n="6">Whereas the said Directive laid down tolerances in respect of the presence of Avena fatua in fodder plant seed;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas these tolerances appeared to be too high for certain requirements;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Commission Directive 74/268/EEC of 2 May 1974 (3) therefore laid down special conditions in respect of the presence of Avena fatua in fodder plant seed;</p>

      <p n="10">Whereas because of these amendments the special conditions contained in Directive 74/268/EEC are no longer necessary;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas these special conditions should therefore be repealed as far as fodder plant seed is concerned;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>

      <p n="19">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="20">Done at Brussels, 24 May 1978.</p>
