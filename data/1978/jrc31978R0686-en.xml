      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 686/78 of 6 April 1978 laying down additional provisions as regards the granting of export refunds on fishery products</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 100/76 of 19 January 1976 on the common organization of the market in fishery products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2560/77 (2),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 110/76 of 19 January 1976 laying down general rules for granting export refunds on fishery products and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), and in particular Article 7 (3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas it has been found that products of Community origin are frozen and/or processed on board a vessel flying the flag of a non-member country ; whereas such products are exported after having been frozen or processed;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the economic conditions under which such operations are carried out are comparable to those of operations carried out in non-member countries where production costs are substantially lower than in the Community ; whereas the granting of export refunds on products frozen and/or processed under such conditions gives these products an unjustified economic advantage;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">For the purposes of the export refund system, fishery products of Community origin frozen and/or processed on board a vessel registered or recorded in a third country and flying the flag of a third country shall be considered to be products which are not of Community origin.</p>
      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">This Regulation shall enter into force on 29 April 1978.</p>
      <p n="15">It shall apply to exports for which customs export formalities have been completed with effect from this date.</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
