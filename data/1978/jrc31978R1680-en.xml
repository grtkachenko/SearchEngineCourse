      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1254/78 (2), and in particular Article 16 (6) thereof,</p>

      <p n="7">Whereas it must be ensured that, when such adjustment is to be made, the barley malt exported during the first two months of the marketing year was in stock at the end of the preceding marketing year or was made from barley in stock at that time ; whereas the quantities of barley and malt in stock at the end of the marketing year in question must therefore be ascertained ; whereas the competent authorities of each Member State should be responsible for ascertaining such quantities and for taking all necessary steps to ensure compliance with the Community provisions concerning the adjustment of export refunds on malt exported during the period under consideration;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,</p>

      <p n="12">2. For the purpose of determining the day of export, the relevant date shall be that on which customs formalities as referred to in Article 9 (3) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 193/75 (3) are completed.</p>
      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">1. To qualify for the adjustment of the export refund on barley malt under Article 16 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 the exporter must: - if the malt was made from barley in stock at the end of the marketing year, supply the competent authority of the Member State responsible for paying the refund with documents certifying: (a) that the barley comes from stocks declared in accordance with Article 3 below to the competent authority of the Member State in whose territory they were situated;</p>
      <p n="15">(b) that the malt was exported after 31 July and before 1 October of the year in question;</p>

      <p n="22">2. If the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled and on application by the interested party, the competent authority shall issue one or more certificates stating that the products exported were actually in stock at the end of the previous marketing year and therefore qualify for the adjustment of the refund in accordance with Article 16 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75.</p>
      <p n="23">Certificates may be issued only in respect of a quantity not exceeding that declared in accordance with paragraph 1. At the request of the party concerned, a previously issued certificate may be exchanged for two or more certificates in respect of part quantities.</p>
