      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE of 14 July 1978 adapting to technical progress Directive 70/220/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against pollution of the air by gases from positive ignition engines installed in motor vehicles (78/665/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), as amended by the Act of Accession, and in particular Articles 11, 12 and 13 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Directive 70/220/EEC of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against pollution of the air by gases from positive-ignition engines of motor vehicles (2), as amended by the Act of Accession, and in particular Article 5 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the first European Community programme of action on the environment approved on 22 November 1973 provides that Directives may be amended in order to take account of the most recent scientific progress and more specifically as regards the pollution of air by gases from spark-ignition engines;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the maximum permissible limits for carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons emitted by sparkignition engines fitted to motor vehicles were laid down in Directive 70/220/EEC ; whereas these limits were initially reduced by Council Directive 74/290/EEC of 28 May 1974 (3), and permissible limits for nitrogen oxide emissions were added by Commission Directive 77/102/EEC of 30 November 1976 (4);</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the requirements relating to the protection of public health and the environment require a further short term reduction in these limits ; whereas the technical advances made in engine design now enable a reduction of this type to be made without running counter to Community policy aims in other fields and in particular that of the rational use of energy;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives aimed at the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Motor-Vehicle Sector,</p>
      <p n="11">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>

      <p n="16">- prohibit the entry into service of such vehicles,</p>
      <p n="17">where the level of gaseous pollutants emitted from this type of motor vehicle or from such vehicles meets the requirements of Directive 70/220/EEC, as last amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="18">2. From 1 October 1979, Member States: - shall no longer issue the document provided for in the last indent of Article 10 (1) of Directive 70/156/EEC in respect of a type of motor vehicle which emits gaseous pollutants at levels which do not meet the requirements of Directive 70/220/EEC, as last amended by this Directive,</p>
      <p n="19">- may refuse national type-approval of a type of motor vehicle which emits gaseous pollutants at levels which do not meet the requirements of Directive 70/220/EEC, as last amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="20">3. From 1 October 1981, Member States may prohibit the entry into service of vehicles which emit gaseous pollutants at levels which do not meet the requirements of Directive 70/220/EEC, as last amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="21">4. Before 1 January 1979, Member States shall put into force the provisions required in order to comply with this Directive and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>

      <p n="86">"ANNEX VII</p>
      <p n="87">METHOD OF CALIBRATING THE DYNAMOMETER</p>
      <p n="88">1. This Annex describes the method to be used to determine the relationship between the indicated power of the dynamometer and the actual power absorbed by the dynamometer.</p>
      <p n="89">The actual power absorbed by the dynamometer (Pa) is the power absorbed by the brake, plus the power absorbed due to friction within the dynamometer, but not the power loss due to the friction between the tyre and roller.</p>
      <p n="90">2. This method disregards the variations in the internal friction of the roller(s), which are due to the load applied by the vehicle.</p>
      <p n="91">3. According to this method the power absorbed is determined on the basis of the deceleration times of the roller(s). The difference between the deceleration time of the driven roller and that of the free roller can be disregarded in the case of two-roller dynamometers, i.e. the time to be taken into consideration is that of the driven roller.</p>
      <p n="92">4. The following procedure will be used: 4.1. Use a flywheel or any other means of simulating the inertia of the mass of the vehicle. Select for this purpose the inertial mass with which the dynamometer is most commonly used.</p>
      <p n="93">4.2. Bring the dynamometer up to speed by placing the vehicle on the rollers, or by any other method.</p>
      <p n="94">4.3. A fifth wheel, revolution counter or any other suitable device may be used to measure the speed(s) of the roller(s).</p>
      <p n="95">4.4. Bring the roller(s) to a speed of 50 km/h and apply a suitable power to the dynamometer in accordance with the table in point 4.2 of Annex III.</p>
      <p n="96">4.5. Note the power indicated (Pi).</p>
      <p n="97">4.6. Bring the roller(s) to a speed of at least 60 km/h.</p>
      <p n="98">4.7. Disengage the device used to bring the dynamometer up to speed (there must be no vehicle on the roller(s)).</p>
      <p n="99">4.8. Note the times taken for the speed of the roller(s) to decrease from 55 to 45 km/h.</p>
      <p n="100">4.9. The power Pa is to be calculated using the formula: &gt;PIC FILE= "T0013477"&gt;</p>
      <p n="101">where:</p>
      <p n="102">Pa = power absorbed by the dynamometer in kW,</p>
      <p n="103">M1 = equivalent inertia of the driven roller in kg,</p>
      <p n="104">V1 = initial speed in m/s (55 km/h = 15 728 m/s),</p>
      <p n="105">V2 = final speed in m/s (45 km/h = 12 750 m/s),</p>
      <p n="106">t = time needed by the roller(s) to slow down from 55 to 45 km/h.</p>
      <p n="107">4.10. Repeat operations 4.4 to 4.9 a sufficient number of times to cover the range of powers set out in Annexes III and V.</p>
      <p n="108">4.11. Diagram showing the indicated power as a function of the power absorbed at 50 km/h. &gt;PIC FILE= "T0013478"&gt;</p>
