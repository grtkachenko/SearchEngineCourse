      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the action in respect of tax exemptions granted to individuals in international travel should be continued so that people in the Member States become more aware of the reality of the common market;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas travel between Member States should be facilitated by an increase in exemptions from turnover tax and excise duty, the amounts of which, as fixed by Directive 69/169/EEC (4), as amended by Directive 72/230/EEC (5), have moreover been reduced, in real terms, by the rise in the cost of living in the Community as a whole;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the introduction of the European unit of account in the legal acts adopted by the institutions of the European Communities in the field of tax exemptions must not have the effect of reducing the amounts expressed in national currency at present eligible for exemption;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the rules governing tax remission at the retail stage should be harmonized in order to prevent instances of double taxation such as those resulting from the current provisions;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas on account of the present economic situation a temporary derogation concerning both the unit value of goods to be imported into the Kingdom of Denmark and into Ireland and the quantitative restriction on still wines to be imported into the Kingdom of Denmark should be granted,</p>
