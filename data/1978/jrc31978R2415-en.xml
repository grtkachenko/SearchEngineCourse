      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1736/75 of 24 June 1975 on the external trade statistics of the Community and statistics of trade between Member States (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2845/77 (2), and in particular Articles 24 and 41 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, since Council Regulation (EEC) No 2845/77 of 19 December 1977 has now entered into force and fixed the new statistical threshold at 300 European Units of Account (EUA), this latter should be converted into national currencies;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the rate of conversion for each currency in relation to the EUA varies from day to day ; whereas to determine the value of the statistical threshold the application of a fixed rate of conversion is required ; whereas this latter rate may be based on the average exchange rates during the period January to December 1977;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas in the interests of simplification the amounts so obtained should be rounded off;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on External Trade Statistics,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">The statistical threshold, within the meaning of Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) No 1736/75, expressed in national currencies, shall not exceed: &gt;PIC FILE= "T0013891"&gt;</p>
      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="16">Done at Brussels, 17 October 1978.</p>
