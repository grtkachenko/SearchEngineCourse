      <head n="1">Council Directive 78/1026/EEC of 18 December 1978 concerning the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in veterinary medicine, including measures to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment and freedom to provide services</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 18 December 1978 concerning the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in veterinary medicine, including measures to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment and freedom to provide services (78/1026/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 49, 57, 66 and 235 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, pursuant to the Treaty, all discriminatory treatment based on nationality with regard to establishment and provision of services is prohibited as from the end of the transitional period ; whereas the principle of such treatment based on nationality applies in particular to the grant of any authorization required to practise as a veterinary surgeon and also to the registration with or membership of professional organizations or bodies;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas it nevertheless seems desirable that certain provisions be introduced to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of the activities of veterinary surgeons;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, pursuant to the Treaty, the Member States are required not to grant any form of aid likely to distort the conditions of establishment;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas Article 57 (1) of the Treaty provides that Directives be issued for mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications ; whereas the aim of this Directive is the recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications whereby activities in the field of veterinary medicine may be taken up and pursued;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, in view of the differences between the Member States regarding the nature and duration of the training of veterinary surgeons, certain coordinating provisions designed to enable Member States to proceed with the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications should be laid down ; whereas such coordination has been effected by Council Directive 78/1027/EEC of 18 December 1978 concerning the coordination of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of the activities of veterinary surgeons (4);</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, with regard to the possession of a formal certificate of training, since a Directive on the mutual recognition of diplomas does not necessarily imply equivalence in the training covered by such diplomas, the use of such qualifications should be authorized only in the language of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, to facilitate the application of this Directive by the national authorities, Member States may prescribe that, in addition to formal certificates of training, the person who satisfies the conditions of training required by this Directive must provide a certificate from the competent authorities of his country of origin or of (1)OJ No C 92, 20.7.1970, p. 18. (2)OJ No C 19, 28.2.1972, p. 10. (3)OJ No C 60, 14.6.1971, p. 3. (4)See page 7 of this Official Journal.</p>
      <p n="15">the country from which he comes stating that these certificates of training are those covered by the Directive;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas, in the case of the provision of services, the requirement of registration with or membership of professional organizations or bodies, since it is related to the fixed and permanent nature of the activity pursued in the host country, would undoubtedly constitute an obstacle to the person wishing to provide the service, by reason of the temporary nature of his activity ; whereas this requirement should therefore be abolished ; whereas, however, in this event, control over professional discipline, which is the responsibility of these professional organizations or bodies, should be guaranteed ; whereas, to this end, it should be provided, subject to the application of Article 62 of the Treaty, that the person concerned may be required to submit to the competent authority of the host Member State particulars relating to the provision of services;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas, with regard to the requirements relating to good character and good repute, a distinction should be drawn between the requirements to be satisfied on first taking up the profession and those to be satisfied in order to practise it;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas, as far as the activities of employed veterinary surgeons are concerned, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (1) lays down no specific provisions relating to good character or good repute, professional discipline or use of title for the professions covered ; whereas, depending on the individual Member State, such rules are or may be applicable both to employed and self-employed persons ; whereas the activities of veterinary surgeons are subject in all Member States to possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification as a veterinary surgeon ; whereas such activities are pursued by both employed and self-employed persons or by the same persons in both capacities in the course of their professional career ; whereas, in order to encourage as far as possible the free movement of those professional persons within the Community, it therefore appears necessary to extend this Directive to employed veterinary surgeons,</p>

      <p n="20">CHAPTER I SCOPE</p>

Host Member States may require this title to be followed by the name and location of the establishment or examining board which awarded it.</p>
      <p n="55">2. If the academic title used in the Member State of origin, or in the Member State from which a foreign national comes, can be confused in the host Member State with a title requiring in that State additional training which the person concerned has not undergone, the host Member State may require such person to use the title employed in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which he comes in suitable wording to be indicated by the host Member State.</p>
      <p n="56">CHAPTER V PROVISIONS TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF ESTABLISHMENT AND FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN RESPECT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF VETERINARY SURGEONS</p>

      <p n="60">2. Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not require proof of good character or good repute of persons wishing to take up the activities in question for the first time, the host Member State may require of nationals of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes an extract from the "judicial record" or, failing this, an equivalent document issued by a competent authority in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes.</p>

If the host Member State has detailed knowledge of a serious matter which has occurred outside its territory and which is likely to affect the taking up within its territory of the activities concerned, it may inform the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes.</p>
      <p n="62">The Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes shall verify the accuracy of the facts. The authorities in that State shall themselves decide on the nature and extent of the investigation to be made and shall inform the host Member State of any consequential action which they take with regard to the certificates or documents they have issued.</p>

      <p n="67">The Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes shall verify the accuracy of the facts.

      <p n="71">Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not impose any requirements of this nature on those wishing to take up or pursue the activities in question, the host Member State shall accept from such national a certificate issued by a competent authority in that State corresponding to the certificates issued in the host Member State.</p>

      <p n="82">Article 12</p>
      <p n="83">1. Where a Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue the activities referred to in Article 1, an authorization or membership of, or registration with, a professional organization or body, that Member State shall in the case of the provision of services exempt the nationals of Member States from that requirement.</p>
      <p n="84">The person concerned shall provide services with the same rights and obligations as the nationals of the host Member State ; in particular he shall be subject to the rules of conduct of a professional or administrative nature which apply in that Member State.</p>
      <p n="85">For this purpose and in addition to the declaration provided for in paragraph 2 relating to the services to be provided, Member States may, so as to permit the implementation of the provisions relating to professional conduct in force in their territory, require either automatic temporary registration or pro forma membership of a professional organization or body or, in the alternative, registration in a register, provided that such registration or membership does not delay or in any way complicate the provision of services or impose any additional costs on the person providing the services.</p>
      <p n="86">Where a host Member State adopts a measure pursuant to the second subparagraph or becomes aware of facts which run counter to these provisions, it shall forthwith inform the Member State where the person concerned is established.</p>
      <p n="87">2. The host Member State may require the person concerned to make a prior declaration to the competent authorities concerning the provision of his services where they involve a temporary stay in its territory. The host Member State may in all cases require a veterinary surgeon established in another Member State to supply a prior declaration of provision of services in the form of a prescription or of veterinary certificates not involving the examination of animals, provided such practice is permissible under the legal and administrative provisions and professional rules applied in the host State.</p>
      <p n="88">The host Member State requiring such prior declaration shall take the steps necessary to provide the possibility that the declaration is made, where appropriate, for a series of services provided within one and the same region and in respect of one or more recipients within a given period of not more than one year.</p>
      <p n="89">In urgent cases this declaration may be made as soon as possible after the services have been provided.</p>

      <p n="94">5. Where a Member State temporarily or permanently deprives, in whole or in part, one of its nationals or a national of another Member State established in its territory of the right to pursue one of the activities referred to in Article 1, it shall, as appropriate, ensure the temporary or permanent withdrawal of the certificate referred to in the second indent of paragraph 3.</p>

      <p n="96">Article 13</p>

      <p n="98">Article 14</p>

      <p n="104">Article 15</p>
      <p n="105">When it has ground for doubt, the host Member State may require of the competent authorities of another Member State confirmation of the authenticity of the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications awarded in that other Member State and referred to in Chapter II and also confirmation of the fact that the person concerned has fulfilled all the training requirements laid down in Directive 78/1027/EEC.</p>
