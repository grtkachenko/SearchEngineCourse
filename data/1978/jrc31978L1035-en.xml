      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 19 December 1978 on the exemption from taxes of imports of small consignments of goods of a non-commercial character from third countries (78/1035/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 99 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Council Directive 74/651/EEC of 19 December 1974 on the tax reliefs to be allowed on the importation of goods in small consignments of a non-commercial character within the Community (4), as amended by Directive 78/1034/EEC (5), laid down the limits and conditions under which such consignments may be exempted from value added tax and from any other taxes on consumption;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Community rules should likewise be laid down for the exemption from turnover taxes and excise duties of imports of small consignments of a similar nature from third countries;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas to that end the limits within which such exemption is to be applied should, for practical reasons, be as far as possible the same as those laid down by the arrangements for exemption from customs duties in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3060/78 (6);</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas finally it appears necessary to set special limits for certain products because of the high level of taxation to which they are at present subject in the Member States,</p>

      <p n="13">Article 1</p>

      <p n="16">- contain only goods intended for the personal or family use of the consignees, the nature and quantity of which do not indicate that they are being imported for any commercial purpose,</p>
      <p n="17">- contain goods with a total value not exceeding 30 EUA.</p>
      <p n="18">- are sent by the sender to the consignee without payment of any kind.</p>

      <p n="40">3. Under no circumstances shall tax exemption granted for small consignments from non-member countries exceed that applicable to small consignments sent within the Community.</p>

      <p n="47">4. Member States may maintain the amount of the exemption in force at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 2 if, prior to the rounding-off provided for in paragraph 3, conversion of the amount of the exemption expressed in EUA would result in a change of less than 5 % in the exemption expressed in national currency.</p>
