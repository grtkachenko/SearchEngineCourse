      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 696/76 of 25 March 1976 derogating from Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 in respect of mobilization procedures for cereals to be supplied as food aid</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3058/75 (2), and in particular Article 28 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation No 359/67/EEC of 25 July 1967 on the common organization of the market in rice (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 668/75 (4), and in particular Article 23 (a) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>

      <p n="9">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="10">Article 1</p>
      <p n="11">By way of derogation from Article 4 (1) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75, a procedure other than a tendering procedure may be used in exceptional cases for the supply of products covered by that Regulation supplied as food aid and delivered fob (or at a corresponding stage) or at a stage later than fob (or at a corresponding stage).</p>
      <p n="12">Article 2</p>
      <p n="13">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="14">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="15">Done at Brussels, 25 March 1976.</p>
