      <head n="1">Council Directive 71/317/EEC of 26 July 1971 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to 5 to 50 kilogramme medium accuracy rectangular bar weights and 1 to 10 kilogramme medium accuracy cylindrical weights</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 26 July 1971 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to 5 to 50 kilogramme medium accuracy rectangular bar weights and 1 to 10 kilogramme medium accuracy cylindrical weights (71/317/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament 1;</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee 2;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas in the Member States the construction and methods of control of medium accuracy rectangular bar and cylindrical weights are subject to mandatory provisions which differ from one Member State to another and consequently hinder trade in such weights ; whereas it is therefore necessary to approximate these provisions;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the Council Directive of 26 July 1971 3 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to provisions for both measuring instruments and methods of metrological control has laid down the EEC pattern approval and EEC initial verification procedures ; whereas, in accordance with that Directive, the technical requirements for the design of medium accuracy rectangular bar and cylindrical weights should be laid down;</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">This Directive applies to medium accuracy weights of the following nominal values: - rectangular bar weights of 5, 10, 20 and 50 kg;</p>
      <p n="13">- cylindrical weights of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 g and 1, 2, 5 and 10 kg.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">The weights which may bear the EEC marks and symbols are described and illustrated in Annexes I-IV. They shall not be subject to EEC pattern approval ; they shall be subject to EEC initial verification.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 3</p>
      <p n="17">No Member State may refuse, prohibit or restrict the placing on the market or entry into service of medium accuracy rectangular bar or cylindrical weights bearing the EEC initial verification mark.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 4</p>
      <p n="19">1. Member States shall put into force the laws, regulations or administrative provisions needed in order to comply with this Directive within eighteen months of its notification, and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="20">2. Member States shall ensure that the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive are communicated to the Commission.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 5</p>
      <p n="22">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 26 July 1971.</p>
