      <head n="1">Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of the Council of 26 July 1971 on the common organisation of the market in hops</head>
      <p n="2">REGULATION (EEC) No 1696/71 OF THE COUNCIL of 26 July 1971 on the common organisation of the market in hops</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 42, 43, 113 and 235 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament 1;</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the operation and development of the common market in agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy and whereas the latter must include in particular a common organisation of agricultural markets, which may take various forms depending on the product concerned;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Community production of hops is of especial interest for the economy of certain regions of the Community ; whereas, for certain farmers in these regions, hop production represents a major part of their income;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, since vegetable saps and extracts of hops are not listed in Annex II to the Treaty, they are excluded from application of the provisions therein concerning agriculture, whilst hops are subject thereto ; whereas, however, since the products in question are broadly speaking interchangeable, this situation is liable to prejudice the effect of the common agricultural policy in hops ; whereas measures adopted for hops in respect of trade with third countries pursuant to Article 113 and the marketing rules adopted for hops pursuant to Article 235 should be extended to vegetable saps and extracts of hops;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas international trade has traditionally held great importance for producers and users of hops within the Community ; whereas in the main the best return on Community production has up to now been obtained through its competitiveness on the world market and through flexible adjustment of quality and quantity of production to marketing outlets ; whereas the common organisation of the markets should not make any basic changes in this situation but should contribute by appropriate measures to the improvement of the quality of the products and protect the producers from any lowering of their present standards of living;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas a quality policy should be followed throughout the Community by implementing provisions concerning certification of the designation of origin together with rules prohibiting, as a general rule, the marketing of products for which the certificate has not been issued or, in the case of imported products, those which do not comply with equivalent minimum quality characteristics ; whereas provision should be made for the definition of a standard quality constituting a basis for reference in commercial transactions and ensuring satisfactory alignment of the market;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas adequate information is needed about the present state of the market within the Community and the prospects for its development ; whereas, in this respect, the fact that a large part of the output is marketed under contracts concluded before the harvest and even for several years may facilitate forward planning for the development of the market ; whereas provision should therefore be made for the registration of all contracts to supply hops produced within the Community ; whereas, however, this information should be kept secret in order to assure the persons concerned that it will be used entirely for statistical purposes and in order thus to obtain entirely objective information;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, in order to stabilise markets and to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural Community and reasonable prices for supplies to consumers, centralisation of the supply and the joint adaptation 1OJ No C 66, 1.7.1971, p. 28.</p>
      <p n="15">by growers of their produce to the requirements of the market should be encouraged;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas to this end the grouping of growers in bodies which require their members to comply with common rules is likely to further the achievement of the objectives of Article 39 of the Treaty ; whereas these objectives may be pursued, in particular, not only by the grouping of growers within producer groups but also by the formation of unions of these groups;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas in order to avoid any discrimination between producers and to ensure the unity and effectiveness of any action undertaken, conditions should be fixed, for the whole of the Community, with which producers' groups and unions of groups must comply in order to be recognised by the Member States ; whereas in order to obtain effective centralisation of supply it is necessary in particular that the groups and unions should be of an economically viable size and that the entire output of member producers of groups should be marketed either directly by the group or by the union or by the producers, according to common rules;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas provision should be made for measures calculated to facilitate the setting up and functioning of these groups ; whereas, to this end, Member States should be allowed to grant them aid to be financed in part by the Community ; whereas, however, the amount of such aid should be limited and should be designated as temporary and degressive so that the financial responsibility of the producers will progressively increase;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas some Community hop gardens need to be adapted in respect both of the varieties produced and of the possibility of rationalising cultivation and harvesting operations ; whereas, for a certain number of years, conversion of the hop gardens to different varieties and their reorganisation should be facilitated by granting specific aid to producers' groups undertaking such activities;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas, in order to ensure a fair standard of living for producers, a system of aid should be provided ; whereas the Commission must present a report to the Council annually after marketing the harvest so that it may be decided whether such aid should be fixed ; whereas the aid may be granted if examination of this report reveals that the average return per hectare has been insufficient taking into account the present state and foreseeable trend of the market;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas the proposed measures must enable a system of importation to be provided for which includes no measures other than the implementation of the Common Customs Tariff ; whereas that tariff applies automatically under the Treaty from 1 January 1970;</p>
      <p n="22">Whereas these measures make it possible to waive all quantitative restriction at the external frontiers of the Community ; whereas this procedure may, however, in exceptional cases, be found to be ineffective ; whereas, in such cases, in order not to leave the Community market defenceless against disturbances liable to arise therefrom once previously existing obstacles to imports have been abolished, the Community must be empowered to take all necessary measures quickly;</p>
      <p n="23">Whereas, in internal Community trade, the levying of any customs duty or charges having an equivalent effect and the application of any quantitative restriction or any measure having an equivalent effect are automatically prohibited from 1 January 1970 under the provisions of the Treaty ; whereas, finally, in the absence of minimum prices on 31 December 1969, recourse to Article 44 of the Treaty is automatically excluded from 1 January 1970;</p>
      <p n="24">Whereas the effectiveness of all the measures governing the common organisation of the market in hops would be prejudiced by the granting of certain aids on the part of the Member States ; whereas the provisions of the Treaty enabling aids granted by the Member States to be evaluated and aids which are incompatible with the common market to be prohibited should be applied to the market in hops ; whereas, however, provision should be made for a temporary system for national aid granted for contracts lasting several years made before the entry into force of the common organisation of the market;</p>
      <p n="25">Whereas the Community should be made financially responsible for expenditure incurred by the Member States as a result of obligations arising from the implementation of this Regulation, in accordance with the provisions of the regulations on the financing of the common agricultural policy;</p>
      <p n="26">Whereas the transition from the system in force in the Member States to that set up by this Regulation must be carried out under the best possible conditions ; whereas, for this reason, temporary measures may prove to be necessary;</p>
      <p n="27">Whereas the common organisation of the market in hops must take account, at the same time and in an appropriate manner, of the objectives laid down in Articles 39 and 110 of the Treaty;</p>
      <p n="28">Whereas in order to facilitate the implementation of the proposed provisions, a procedure should be laid down establishing close co-operation between the Member States and the Commission within a Management Committee;</p>
      <p n="29">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="30">Article 1</p>
      <p n="31">1. A common organisation of the market in hops shall be established, covering the following products: &gt;PIC FILE= "T0010801"&gt;</p>

      <p n="95">Article 11</p>
      <p n="96">Each year before 30 April the Commission shall submit a report to the Council on the situation regarding the production and marketing of hops.</p>
      <p n="97">The report shall take account, in particular, of price trends and the developments in hop gardens, production and requirements.</p>
      <p n="98">Article 12</p>
      <p n="99">1. A system of aid shall be established for hops produced in the Community.</p>
      <p n="100">2. Aid may be granted to producers to enable them to achieve a fair income.</p>
      <p n="101">3. The amount of this aid, per hectare which will differ according to variety, shall be fixed taking into account: (a) the average return in comparison with the average returns for previous harvests;</p>
      <p n="102">(b) the current position and foreseeable trend of the market in the Community;</p>
      <p n="103">(c) external market trends and world market prices.</p>
      <p n="104">4. Where the report referred to in Article 11 shows that there is a risk of creating structural surpluses or a disturbance in the supply structure of the Community hop market, the granting of aid may be limited to an amount corresponding to a given area on the basis of the average of the areas cultivated during the three years preceding that under review.</p>
      <p n="105">5. The amount of aid which is valid for the areas relating to the harvest of the preceding calendar year shall be fixed, before 30 June, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty</p>

      <p n="107">1. Aid shall be granted to producers for registered areas on which the crop has been harvested.</p>
      <p n="108">Member States shall designate the bodies which are competent to register, for each producer, the areas given over to growing hops, and which are responsible for control and keeping the registration up to date.</p>
      <p n="109">2. For the purposes of this Article, Member States may consider a recognised producer group as a single producer.</p>
      <p n="110">3. The Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt general rules for the application of this Article.</p>

      <p n="114">Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation or where derogation therefrom is decided upon by the Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure provided for in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, the following shall be prohibited in trade with third countries: (a) the levying of any charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty;</p>
      <p n="115">(b) the application of any quantitative restriction or any measures having an equivalent effect.</p>
      <p n="116">Article 15</p>
      <p n="117">1. If, by reason of imports or exports, the Community market in the products listed in Article 1 experiences or is threatened with serious disturbances which may endanger the objectives of Article 39 of the Treaty, appropriate measures may be applied in trade with third countries until such disturbance or threat of disturbance has ceased.</p>
      <p n="118">The Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt detailed rules for the application of this paragraph and define the cases in which and the limits within which Member States may take protective measures.</p>
      <p n="119">2. If the situation mentioned in paragraph 1 arises, the Commission shall, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, decide upon the necessary measures ; the measures shall be communicated to the Member States and shall be immediately applicable. If the Commission receives a request from a Member State, it shall take a decision within twenty-four hours following receipt of the request.</p>
      <p n="120">3. The measures decided upon by the Commission may be referred to the Council by any Member State within three working days following the day on which they were communicated. The Council shall meet without delay. It may amend or repeat the measures in question in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty.</p>

      <p n="123">Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation, Articles 92, 93 and 94 of the Treaty shall apply to the production of and trade in the products listed in Article 1 (1).</p>
      <p n="124">However, aid granted by a Member State to hop producers may be maintained during the period of validity of contracts entered into before the date of entry into force of this Regulation, in so far as this aid exceeds the amount of Community aid provided for in Article 12. The time for this aid may not be extended.</p>
      <p n="125">Article 17</p>
      <p n="126">1. The provisions laid down by the regulations on the financing of the common agricultural policy shall apply to the market in the products listed in Article 1</p>
