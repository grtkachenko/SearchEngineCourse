      <p n="8">Whereas, for the sake of facilitating the administration of the quota, provision should be made for France to take the decisions on the application of the single reduction coefficient for the quantities applied for; whereas such a delegation of powers makes it necessary for the Commission to be informed regularly of the decisions taken to this end;</p>

      <p n="15">4. Licences shall be issued on the fifth working day following the day on which applications are submitted at the latest.</p>
