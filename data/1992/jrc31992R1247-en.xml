      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1247/92 of 30 April 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 51 and 235 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, drawn up after consulting the Administrative Commission on Social Security for Migrant Workers(1) ,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2) ,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3) ,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas it is necessary to amend Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71(4) , as updated by Regulation (EEC) No 2001/83(5) , as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2195/91(6) ;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas it is necessary to extend the definition of 'member of the family' in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 to conform with the case law of the Court of Justice concerning the interpretation of that expression;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas it is also necessary to take account of the case law of the Court of Justice stating that certain benefits provided under national laws may fall simultaneously within the categories of both social security and social assistance because of the class of persons to whom such laws apply, their objectives and their manner of application;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the Court of Justice has stated that, in some of its features, legislation under which such benefits are granted is akin to social assistance in that need is an essential criterion in its implementation and the conditions of entitlement are not based upon the aggregation of periods of employment or contributions, whilst in other features it is close to social security to the extent that there is an absence of discretion in the manner in which such benefits as are provided thereunder are awarded and in that it confers a legally defined position upon beneficiaries;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 excludes from its scope, by virtue of Article 4 (4) thereof, social assistance schemes;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the conditions referred to and their methods of application are such that a system of coordination which differs from that currently provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and which takes account of the special characteristics of the benefits concerned should be included in that Regulation in order to protect the interests of migrant workers in accordance with the provisions of Article 51 of the Treaty;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas such benefits should be granted, in respect of persons falling within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, solely in accordance with the legislation of the country of residence of the person concerned or of the members of his or her family, with such aggregation of periods of residence completed in any other Member State as is necessary and without discrimination on grounds of nationality;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas it is necessary nevertheless to ensure that the existing system of coordination in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 continues to apply to benefits which either do not fall within the special category of benefits referred to or are not expressly included in an Annex to that Regulation; whereas a new Annex is needed for this purpose,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="19">1. In Article 1:</p>
      <p n="20">(a) point (f) shall become point (f) (i), and the following shall be inserted as point (f) (ii):</p>
      <p n="21">'(ii) where, however, the benefits concerned are benefits for disabled persons granted under the legislation of a Member State to all nationals of that State who fulfil the prescribed conditions, the term 'member of the family' means at least the spouse of an employed or self-employed person and the children of such person who are either minors or dependent upon such person;';</p>
      <p n="22">(b) the following words shall be added to the first subparagraph of point (j);</p>
      <p n="23">'or those special non-contributory benefits covered by Article 4 (2a).';</p>
      <p n="24">2. In Article 4, the following paragraphs shall be inserted:</p>
      <p n="25">'2a. This Regulation shall also apply to special non-contributory benefits which are provided under a legislation or schemes other than those referred to in paragraph 1 or excluded by virtue of paragraph 4, where such benefits are intended:</p>
      <p n="26">(a) either to provide supplementary, substitute or ancillary cover against the risks covered by the branches of social security referred to in paragraph 1 (a) to (h), or</p>
      <p n="27">(b) solely as specific protection for the disabled.</p>
      <p n="28">2b. This Regulation shall not apply to the provisions in the legislation of a Member State concerning special non-contributory benefits, referred to in Annex II, Section III, the validity of which is confined to part of its territory.';</p>
      <p n="29">3. Article 5 shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="30">'Article 5</p>
      <p n="31">Declarations by the Member States on the scope of this Regulation</p>
      <p n="32">The Member States shall specify the legislation and schemes referred to in Article 4 (1) and (2), the special non-contributory benefits referred to in Article 4 (2a), the minimum benefits referred to in Article 50 and the benefits referred to in</p>
      <p n="33">Articles 77 an 78 in declarations to be notified and published in accordance with Article 97.';</p>
      <p n="34">4. The following Article shall be inserted:</p>
      <p n="35">'Article 10a</p>
      <p n="36">Special non-contributory benefits</p>
      <p n="37">1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 10 and Title III, persons to whom this Regulation applies shall be granted the special non-contributory cash benefits referred to in Article 4 (2a) exclusively in the territory of the Member State in which they reside, in accordance with the legislation of that State, provided that such benefits are listed in Annex IIa. Such benefits shall be granted by and at the expense of the institution of the place of residence.</p>
      <p n="38">2. The institution of a Member State under whose legislation entitlement to benefits covered by paragraph 1 is subject to the completion of periods of employment, self-employment or residence shall regard, to the extent necessary, periods of employment, self-employment or residence completed in the territory of any other Member State as periods completed in the territory of the first Member State.</p>
      <p n="39">3. Where entitlement to a benefit covered by paragraph 1 but granted in the form of a supplement is subject, under the legislation of a Member State, to receipt of a benefit covered by Article 4 (1) (a) to (h), and no such benefit is due under that legislation, any corresponding benefit granted under the legislation of any other Member State shall treated as a benefit granted under the legislation of the first Member State for the purposes of entitlement to the supplement.</p>
      <p n="40">4. Where the granting of a disability or invalidity benefit covered by paragraph 1 is subject, under the legislation of a Member State, to the condition that the disability or invalidity should be diagnosed for the first time in the territory of that Member State, this condition shall be deemed to be fulfilled where such diagnosis is made for the first time in the territory of another Member State.';</p>
      <p n="41">5. The following shall be added to Annex II:</p>
      <p n="42">'III. Special non-contributory benefits within the meaning of Article 4 (2b) which do not fall within the scope of the Regulation</p>
