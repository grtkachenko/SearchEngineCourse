      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 762/92 of 27 March 1992 modifying Annex V to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 675/92 (2), and in particular Article 11 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas it is desirable in the interests of administrative efficiency that the information and particulars to be included in an application for the establishment of a maximum residue limit for a pharmacologically active substance used in veterinary medicinal products in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should correspond as closely as possible to the information and particulars to be submitted to Member States in an application for authorization to place a veterinary medicinal product on the market submitted in accordance with Article 5 of Council Directive 81/851/EEC of 28 September 1981 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to veterinary medicinal products (3), as amended by Directive 90/676/EEC (4);</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas it is necessary to amend Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 to take account of the changes to the requirements for the testing of veterinary medicinal products introduced by Commission Directive 92/18/EEC of 20 March 1992 modifying the Annex to Council Directive 81/852/EEC on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to analytical, pharmaco-toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of veterinary medicinal products;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the provisions of this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives on the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Veterinary Medicinal Products Sector established under Article 2b of Council Directive 81/852/EEC (5), as amended by Directive 87/20/EEC (6),</p>
      <p n="9">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="10">Article 1</p>
