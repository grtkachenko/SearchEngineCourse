      <p n="8">Whereas scrutiny of the data supplied by Germany shows that the conditions laid down in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 are fulfilled by new regions; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1981/82 should therefore be amended as from the 1991 harvest,</p>

      <p n="10">Article 1</p>
      <p n="11">The regions 'Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt and Thueringen' are hereby added to the list set out in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 1981/82.</p>
