      <p n="9">Whereas Article 34 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1780/89 of 21 June 1989 laying down detailed rules for the disposal of alcohol obtained from the distillation operations referred to in Articles 35, 36 and 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and held by intervention agencies (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2864/92 (9), provides for the representative market rate to be used to convert the payments, guarantees and securities concerned;</p>
