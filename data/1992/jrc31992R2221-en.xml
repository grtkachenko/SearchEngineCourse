      <p n="8">Whereas the optical indication of the type of farming should be limited to the terms listed in Regulation (EEC) No 1274/91, with the exception of organic or biological farming; whereas in order to facilitate checks throughout the Community, the lists of registered producers should be exchanged between Member States and records of stocks of graded eggs should be kept by packing centres on a weekly basis;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the terms used for the food industry should be harmonized;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the provisions concerning the use of the term 'extra' should be amended in order to specify the conditions under which this term may appear on the pack;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas a positive weight tolerance should be introduced to assure fair competition between operators;</p>
