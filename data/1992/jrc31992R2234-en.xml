      <p n="8">Whereas certain detailed rules for the application of the measure in question should be laid down, including the quantity of milk products qualifying for the aid;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the administrative authorities should be endowed with appropriate instruments for preventing the aid in question from being diverted from its objectives, which are regular disposal on the local market of locally produced fresh cows' milk products and the passing on of the benefit to the final consumer;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas control measures should be established by the national authorities to ensure that the aid scheme operates properly; whereas provision should be made for periodic reporting to the Commission;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the arrangements established by Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 entered into force on 1 July 1992; whereas the detailed rules for their application should take effect on the same date;</p>

      <p n="30">2. Portugal shall notify the Commission within three months of the entry into force of this Regulation of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p n="31">Article 4</p>
