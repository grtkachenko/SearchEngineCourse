      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2719/92 of 11 September 1992 on the accompanying administrative document for the movement under duty-suspension arrangements of products subject to excise duty</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (1), and in particular Articles 18 (1) and 19 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the Committee on Excise Duties,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the movement of products subject to excise duty between tax warehouses and between a tax warehouse and a registered or non-registered operator takes place under duty-suspension arrangements; whereas it is necessary to establish in a binding manner the form and content of the accompanying document which might be either an administrative or a commercial document;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas it is also necessary to determine who shall pass on the fourth copy of the accompanying document intended for the competent authorities to those authorities and how this should take place; whereas it is desirable and in line with practice to place this obligation on the consignee in the country of destination, since only he is in a position to make available to his competent authorities this document, which is important for the purposes of the tax supervision, without the danger of it being misdirected; whereas the fourth copy too should carry a certification of receipt, if this is requested by the competent authorities of the Member State of destination, which indicates to those authorities that the goods were received in the consignee's tax warehouse,</p>
      <p n="9">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="10">Article 1</p>
      <p n="11">The document shown in the Annex shall be used as the administrative document accompanying the movement under duty-suspension arrangements of products subject to excise duty within the meaning of Article 3 (1) of Council Directive 92/12/EEC. The instructions concerning completion of the document and the procedures for its use are shown on the reverse of copy 1 of this document.</p>
      <p n="12">Article 2</p>
      <p n="13">1. A commercial document may replace the administrative document provided it contains the same information required to be shown in the administrative document.</p>
      <p n="14">2. A commercial document which does not have the same layout as the administrative document must contain the same elements of information required by the administrative document, and the nature of the information items must be identified by a number corresponding to the relative box number on the administrative document.</p>
      <p n="15">Article 3</p>
      <p n="16">Where products subject to excise duty are moved in fixed pipelines the Member States involved may, by mutual agreement, authorize the type and quantity of goods moved between the consignor tax warehouse and the consignee tax warehouse to be reported by computerized procedures which will replace the accompanying document. Such arrangement should be sufficient to ensure that all the data necessary for inventory control and for collection of duty are provided.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 4</p>
      <p n="18">The consignee, if required by the competent authorities of the Member State of destination, shall annotate the fourth copy of the accompanying document with the same certification of receipt as on the third copy (copy for return) and shall make it available to the competent authorities to which he reports in accordance with their instructions.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 5</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1993. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Done at Brussels, 11 September 1992. For the Commission</p>
