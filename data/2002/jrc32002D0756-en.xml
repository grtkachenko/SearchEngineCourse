      <p n="19">(1) Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 68/193/EEC, 92/33/EEC, 2002/54/EC, 2002/55/EC, 2002/56/EC and 2002/57/EC provide for the necessary arrangements to be made by the Commission for Community comparative trials and tests of seed and propagating material.</p>
      <p n="20">(2) Adequate representativity of the samples included in the trials and tests should be ensured, at least for certain selected plants.</p>
      <p n="21">(3) Member States should participate in the Community comparative trials and tests, in so far as seeds of the plants concerned are usually reproduced or marketed in their territories, in order to ensure that proper conclusions may be drawn therefrom.</p>
      <p n="22">(4) The arrangements for the trials and tests in relation to seed potatoes also cover, inter alia, certain harmful organisms which come within the scope of Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community(13), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/28/EC(14).</p>
      <p n="23">(5) Community comparative trials and tests should be carried out from the year 2003 to 2004 on seeds and propagating material harvested in 2002, and the details of such trials and tests should also be set out.</p>
      <p n="24">(6) For Community comparative trials and tests lasting more than one year, the parts of the trials and tests following the first year should be authorised by the Commission without further reference to the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry, on condition that the necessary appropriations are available.</p>

      <p n="35">If samples are confirmed to be contaminated by any of the relevant harmful organisms, the measures required under the Community plant health regime shall be taken.</p>
