      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EC) No 334/2002 of 18 February 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 laying down a uniform format for visas</head>
      <p n="2">Council Regulation (EC) No 334/2002</p>
      <p n="3">of 18 February 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 laying down a uniform format for visas</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(b)(iii) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95(3) laid down a uniform format for visas.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Measure No 38 of the Vienna Action Plan, adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 3 December 1998, states that attention must be given to new technical developments in order to ensure, where appropriate, greater security in the uniform format for visas.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Conclusion No 22 of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 states that a common active policy on visas and false documents should be further developed.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) The establishment of a uniform visa format is an essential element in the harmonisation of visa policy.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) It is necessary to make provision for the establishment of common standards relating to the implementation of the uniform format for visas, in particular common rules on the technical methods and standards to be used for filling in the form.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) The integration of a photograph produced according to high security standards is a first step towards the use of elements establishing a more reliable link between the uniform format visa and the holder as an important contribution to ensuring that the uniform format for visas is protected even against fraudulent use. The specifications set out in ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) document 9303 on machine readable visas will be taken into account.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) Common standards relating to the implementation of the uniform format for visas are essential to meet high technical standards and to facilitate detection of forged or falsified visa stickers.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) The powers to adopt such common standards should be conferred on the Committee set up by Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 which should be adapted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4).</p>
      <p n="18">(9) Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 should therefore be amended.</p>
      <p n="19">(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation to make the uniform format for visas more secure do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents.</p>
      <p n="20">(11) The conditions governing entry into the territory of the Member States or the issue of visas do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents.</p>
      <p n="21">(12) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis falling within the area referred to in Article 1, point B, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(5).</p>
      <p n="22">(13) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom gave notice, by letter of 4 December 2001, of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="23">(14) In accordance with Article 1 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation. As a result, and without prejudice to Article 4 of the said Protocol, the provisions of this Regulation do not apply to Ireland,</p>
      <p n="24">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="25">Article 1</p>
      <p n="26">Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 is hereby amended as follows:</p>

      <p n="31">2. The colours of the visa sticker may be changed in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 6(2)."</p>

      <p n="42">This Regulation shall not affect the powers of the Member States regarding recognition of States and territorial entities and passports, identity documents and travel documents issued by their authorities.</p>
