      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 234/79 of 5 February 1979 on the procedure for adjusting the Common Customs Tariff nomenclature used for agricultural products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94(2), and in particular Article 2(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 969/2002(4), contains the Combined Nomenclature currently in force.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Some of the codes and descriptions in the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 827/68(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 195/96(6), no longer correspond to those in the Combined Nomenclature. The Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 827/68 should therefore be amended. For ease of readability, the Annex to that Regulation should be replaced by a new, updated Annex.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of all the Management Committees concerned,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">The Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 827/68 is replaced by the Annex hereto.</p>
      <p n="15">Article 2</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="18">Done at Brussels, 12 July 2002.</p>
