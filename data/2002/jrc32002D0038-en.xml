      <p n="2">Commission Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 27 December 2001</p>
      <p n="4">setting out the survey parameters and laying down the code and standard rules for the transcription, in machine-readable form, of the data relating to the surveys on plantations of certain species of fruit trees</p>
      <p n="5">(notified under document number C(2001) 4626)</p>
      <p n="6">(2002/38/EC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 76/625/EEC, of 20 July 1976, concerning the statistical surveys to be carried out by the Member States in order to determine the production potential of plantations of certain species of fruit trees(1), and in particular Article 4(2) and (4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) The equipment which the Commission has to analyse the survey results on plantations of certain species of fruit trees and the need to use this equipment in a rational way requires that the machine-readable media compatible with this equipment be specified and that a standard format be prescribed for the transcription of data in machine-readable form.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) In certain production areas there are homogeneous climatic and agronomic conditions corresponding to fairly considerable uniformity of fruit yields per hectare; the use of the survey results for each of these production areas increases the accuracy of the medium-term estimates of production; the limits of these production areas will be set out.</p>
      <p n="13">(3) It is necessary to survey the technical characteristics which are likely to be changed, in order to ensure that the statistics are constantly adapted to economic conditions.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in line with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics, instituted by Council Decision 72/279/EEC(2),</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">The limits of the production areas to be set and their respective codes are set out in Annex I to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">The statistical classes on the age of the trees planted referred to in Article 2(1)(B) of Directive 76/625/EEC are listed in Annex II to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 3</p>
      <p n="21">The species of fruit and the varieties referred to in Article 2(1)(A) of Directive 76/625/EEC are listed in Annex III to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 4</p>
      <p n="23">The statistical classes for the net area planted, the number of trees and the density of plantation referred to in Article 2(1)(C) of Directive 76/625/EEC are listed in Annex IV to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="24">Article 5</p>
      <p n="25">The codes for the transcription, on computer or multimedia medium, of the data referred to in Article 4 of Directive 76/625/EEC must conform to the description given in Annex V to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 6</p>
      <p n="27">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="28">Done at Brussels, 27 December 2001.</p>

      <p n="41">The area of each age class is given in ares.</p>
      <p n="42">(1) The date of grafting has no influence on the age of the trees.</p>
      <p n="43">ANNEX III</p>
      <p n="44">Codes per species and variety to be applied when transmitting to the Commission the results of the statistical surveys on the plantations of certain species of fruit trees</p>
