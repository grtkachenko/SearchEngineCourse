      <p n="7">(2002/255/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(1), and in particular Article 4 and Article 6(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 the Community eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria shall be established according to product groups.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The measures provided for in this Decision are based on the draft criteria developed by the European Union Eco-Labelling Board established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">In order to be awarded the Community eco-label under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, a television must fall within the product group as defined in Article 2 of this Decision and must comply with the criteria set out in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">The product group "televisions" shall comprise: "Mains powered electronic equipment which is designed to receive, decode and display TV transmission signals, whether analogue or digital, broadcast via satellite, cable or antenna signals and has a screen size of ten inches (25 cm) or more."</p>
      <p n="21">Article 3</p>
      <p n="22">For administrative purposes the code number assigned to televisions shall be "022".</p>

      <p n="24">This Decision shall apply from 1 April 2002 until 31 March 2005. If on 31 March 2005 revised criteria have not been adopted, this Decision shall apply until 31 March 2006.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 5</p>
      <p n="26">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="27">Done at Brussels, 25 March 2002.</p>

      <p n="31">(1) OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="32">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="33">FRAMEWORK</p>
      <p n="34">The aims of the criteria</p>
      <p n="35">These criteria aim in particular at promoting:</p>
      <p n="36">- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of energy (global warming, acidification, depletion of non-renewable resources) by reducing energy consumption,</p>
      <p n="37">- the reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by encouraging the reuse, recyclability and maintainability of a television,</p>
      <p n="38">- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of hazardous substances by reducing the use of such substances.</p>
      <p n="39">The criteria encourage the implementation of best practice (optimal environmental use) and enhance consumers' environmental awareness. Furthermore, the marking of plastic components encourages recycling.</p>
      <p n="40">The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of televisions that are produced with low environmental impact.</p>
      <p n="41">Assessment and verification requirements</p>
      <p n="42">The specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion.</p>
      <p n="43">Where appropriate, test methods other than those indicated for each criterion may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body assessing the application.</p>
      <p n="44">Where possible, testing should be performed by appropriately accredited laboratories or laboratories that meet the requirements expressed in standard EN ISO 17025 and are competent to perform the relevant tests.</p>
      <p n="45">Where appropriate, competent bodies may require supporting documentation and may carry out independent verifications.</p>
      <p n="46">The competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria (note: it is not required to implement such management schemes).</p>
      <p n="47">CRITERIA</p>
      <p n="48">1. Energy savings</p>
      <p n="49">(a) The television (hereinafter also referred to as "the product") shall have an off-switch which is placed at the front of the television and is clearly visible.</p>
      <p n="50">(b) The passive(1) stand-by consumption of the television shall be &lt;= 1,0 watt.</p>
      <p n="51">(c) For televisions which have an integrated digital receiver/decoder (IRD), the active stand-by consumption(2) of the television shall be &lt;= 9,0 watts.</p>
      <p n="52">(d) The television shall have an on-mode energy efficiency index (EEIon) which is lower than 65 % of the base-case consumption for a television of that format. The on-mode energy efficiency index EEIon shall be derived from the equation:</p>
      <p n="53">&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p>
      <p n="54">where:</p>
      <p n="55">Pon is the measured energy consumption of the television in the on mode;</p>
      <p n="56">Pon,bc is the base-case energy consumption of the television in the on mode. This is calculated using the following formula:</p>
      <p n="57">&gt;PIC FILE= "L_2002087EN.005402.TIF"&gt;</p>

      <p n="61">- scrnsize is the screen diagonal in cm,</p>
      <p n="62">- scrnarea is the area of the screen in dm2, i.e. it is equal to scrnsize × scrnsize × 0,48/100 for a standard screen (4:3 aspect ratio), and scrnsize × scrnsize × 0,427/100 for a wide screen (16:9 aspect ratio),</p>
      <p n="63">- idd is equal to 1 if the TV has an integrated digital decoder for digital broadcast signals, otherwise it is equal to 0.</p>
      <p n="64">Assessment and verification:</p>
      <p n="65">the applicant shall provide a test report stating that the level of power consumption in each of these modes has been measured using the procedures shown in EN 50301 (methods of measurement on receivers for TV broadcast transmission). The report shall state the measured power consumption in each mode, the calculated base-case on-mode consumption, and the calculated percentage of base-case consumption in the on-mode.</p>
      <p n="66">2. Life-time extension</p>
      <p n="67">The manufacturer shall offer a commercial guarantee to ensure that the television will function for at least two years. This guarantee shall be valid from the date of delivery to the customer.</p>
      <p n="68">The availability of compatible electronic replacement parts shall be guaranteed for 7 years from the time that production ceases.</p>
