      <p n="2">Decision No 2045/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 21 October 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Decision No 1720/1999/EC adopting a series of actions and measures in order to ensure interoperability of and access to trans-European networks for the electronic interchange of data between administrations (IDA)</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 156 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">After consulting the Committee of the Regions,</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) The objective of Decision No 1720/1999/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(4) is for the Community to achieve a high degree of interoperability between the trans-European telematic networks established between the Member States and the Community institutions in order to support the establishment of economic and monetary union and the implementation of Community policies, as well as to achieve substantial benefits for Member State administrations and the Community by streamlining operations and speeding up implementation of new networks and enhancements.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) The benefits of trans-European telematic networks for administrations should be extended to citizens and enterprises of the Community, notably in those areas where this contributes to the objectives of the eEurope initiative and related action plan, in particular the chapter on Government online.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Due account should be taken of the recommendations contained in the Declaration issued at the Ministerial Conference on eGovernment "From Policy to Practice" held in Brussels on 29 and 30 November 2001, as well as the conclusions of the Conference "eGovernment in the service of European citizens and enterprises - what is required at the European level", organised jointly by the Presidency of the Council and the Commission (IDA) in Stockholm/Sandhamn on 13 and 14 June 2001.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) Regarding the spread of best practice, conferences, workshops and other types of events should be organised in order to ensure general awareness of the achievements and benefits of the IDA projects and actions and encourage a broad discussion on the future direction and priorities of the IDA programme.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) For the implementation of the Community Actions set out in Articles 3 to 10 of Decision No 1720/1999/EC it should be clarified that proposals for any budgetary increase of more than EUR 250000 per project line within a year are subject to the procedure referred to in that Decision.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) Following the interest expressed by Malta and Turkey, the IDA programme may be opened to participation by these countries in the horizontal actions and measures under Decision No 1720/1999/EC. Before the IDA programme has been opened up for full participation to all candidate countries, the possibility for these countries to use at their own cost IDA generic services in order to implement a Community policy should be facilitated. This possibility should also be afforded to other non-member countries, under the same conditions.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) With a view to creating more flexibility in the annual budget allocation, a financial reference amount for the implementation of the Community action under Decision No 1720/1999/EC for the period 2002-2004 should be introduced, with the annual appropriations being authorised by the budgetary authority within the limit of the financial perspective.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).</p>
      <p n="20">(9) Decision No 1720/1999/EC should be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="21">HAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>

      <p n="28">"(f) where appropriate, the identification and deployment of pan-European electronic government services for citizens and enterprises and other relevant electronic government services to be used in line with the priorities laid down in Article 4 of Decision No 1719/1999/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 1999 on a series of guidelines, including the identification of projects of common interest, for trans-European networks for the electronic interchange of data between administrations (IDA)(6)."</p>
