      <p n="101">(2) It can be assumed that an establishment has an internal emergency plan, when the competent authorities, on the basis of the examination of the safety report, have proof that an internal emergency plan exists. Unless other elements indicate otherwise, it will be assumed that an establishment has no internal emergency plan if the safety report has not been sent, or if the safety report has been examined and does not prove the existence of an internal emergency plan. In the cases where the safety report has been received but not yet examined, the situation has to be qualified as "under assessment".</p>
      <p n="102">(3) In questions 8(b), 8(c), 8(d) and 8(e), the wording "inspected" relates to inspections that have led to the preparation of a report as requested in Article 18(2)(b).</p>
