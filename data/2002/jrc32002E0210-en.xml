      <head n="1">Council Joint Action of 11 March 2002 on the European Union Police Mission</head>
      <p n="2">Council Joint Action</p>
      <p n="3">of 11 March 2002</p>
      <p n="4">on the European Union Police Mission</p>
      <p n="5">(2002/210/CFSP)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty on European Union and, in particular, Article 14 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) On 18 February 2002, the Council announced the readiness of the European Union to ensure, by 1 January 2003, the follow-on to the United Nations International Police Task Force (IPTF) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).</p>
      <p n="10">(2) In line with the general objectives of Annex 11 of the Dayton/Paris Agreement, the European Union Police Mission (EUPM) should establish sustainable policing arrangements under BiH ownership in accordance with best European and international practice, and thereby raising current BiH police standards. The EUPM, entrusted with the necessary authority to monitor, mentor and inspect, should achieve its goals by the end of 2005.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) In its conclusions of 18 February 2002 the Council also decided that in order to ensure a successful follow-up to the UN IPTF, the Union's aim should be a broad approach with activities addressing the whole range of Rule of Law aspects, including institution building programmes and police activities which should be mutually supportive and reinforcing. The EUPM, supported by the Community's institution building programmes under the CARDS Regulation, should contribute to the overall peace implementation in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as to the achievements of the Union's overall policy in the region, notably the Stabilisation and Association Process.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The Union should continue to coordinate with the UN and to consult with relevant organisations, in particular NATO and the OSCE.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) Following the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board acceptance on 28 February 2002 of the Union offer concerning EUPM, the UN Security Council Resolution 1396 (2002) on 5 March 2002 welcoming the Union's readiness to ensure the follow-on to the IPTF.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) On 4 March 2002, the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina invited the Union to assume responsibility for the follow-on to the United Nations police mission. An agreement will need to be concluded to this end between the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Union.</p>
      <p n="15">(7) In order to prepare the EUPM a Planning Team should be established.</p>
      <p n="16">(8) On 18 February 2002, the Council expressed its willingness to appoint the next High Representative in BiH as the EU Special Representative in BiH (EUSR).</p>
      <p n="17">(9) The Political and Security Committee should exercise political control of and provide strategic direction to the EUPM and should be informed on a regular basis on all aspects of the mission, including through briefings by the EUSR and the Head of Mission/Police Commissioner as necessary.</p>
      <p n="18">(10) Acknowledging the valuable contributions other States have made to IPTF, non-EU States are invited to contribute to an EUPM in BiH. In the first instance non-EU European NATO members and other States which are candidates for accession to the Union as well as other non-EU OSCE Member States, currently providing staff to IPTF are invited to contribute to the EUPM.</p>
      <p n="19">(11) On 18 February 2002, the Council agreed the financing of the EUPM as set out in Annex IV of its Conclusions.</p>
      <p n="20">(12) Article 14(1) of the Treaty on European Union calls for the indication of a financial reference amount for the whole period of implementation of the Joint Action. The indication of amounts to be financed by the Community budget illustrates the will of the legislative authority and is subject to the availability of commitment appropriations during the respective budget year,</p>

      <p n="103">2. The EUPM, supported by the Commission's institution building programmes, should, as part of a broader rule of law approach, aim, in line with the general objectives of Annex 11 of the Dayton Agreement, to establish sustainable policing arrangements under BiH ownership in accordance with best European and international practice, and thereby raising current BiH police standards. To do so, this three-year EUPM should be entrusted with the necessary authority and concentrate on the following goals:</p>
      <p n="104">- to preserve, through continuity with the achievements of the IPTF mission, the existing levels of institutional and personal proficiency;</p>
      <p n="105">- to enhance, through monitoring, mentoring and inspecting, police managerial and operational capacities; to this end, to focus on delegation of power and quality-oriented management principles as well as improving operational planning capacity based on analysis;</p>
      <p n="106">- to strengthen professionalism at high level within the ministries as well as at senior police officers levels through advisory and inspection functions;</p>
      <p n="107">- and to monitor the exercise of appropriate political control over the police.</p>
      <p n="108">3. The mission will not include executive powers or the deployment of an armed component.</p>
      <p n="109">II. Objectives at operational level</p>
      <p n="110">4. The EUPM, entrusted with the necessary authority to monitor, mentor and inspect, and working as an integral part of the broader rule of law approach, should achieve the goals set out above by the end of 2005, by ensuring that the BiH police services will:</p>
      <p n="111">- act in a professional manner and in accordance with relevant legislation and regulations;</p>
      <p n="112">- be free of political interference, and led by an apolitical, qualified and accountable personnel;</p>

      <p n="116">- be based on a transparent structure that takes into consideration the multiple ethnic composition of the society and that can deal satisfactorily with gender related issues;</p>
      <p n="117">- effectively manage personnel and resources within an affordable and appropriate institutional framework;</p>
      <p n="118">- standardise data recording and analysis systems to facilitate information sharing for operational planning and investigations, with a view to promoting a BiH-wide crime statistics system;</p>

      <p n="124">- enter into constructive cooperation with police services of neighbouring States (SAP States) and EU Member States.</p>
      <p n="125">III. Methodology</p>
      <p n="126">5.

      <p n="127">6. In order to achieve the abovementioned objectives by the end of 2005, the EUPM should:</p>
      <p n="128">- co-locate the international police alongside Commanders at the various Entities, Public Security Centres (PSCs), Cantons, Brcko district, State Intelligence Protection Agency (SIPA) and State Border Service (SBS) at medium and senior levels of the BiH Police;</p>
      <p n="129">- be able to remove from offices non compliant officers, through a recommendation by the EU police Commissioner to the High Representative;</p>
      <p n="130">- coordinate with the Office of the High Representative in the furtherance of the International Community overall objectives in the field of the rule of the law, as well as with other organisations within the international community, as appropriate;</p>
      <p n="131">- liaise with SFOR on public security issues including for ensuring SFOR support in extremis.</p>
