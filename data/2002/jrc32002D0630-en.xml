      <head n="1">2002/630/JHA: Council Decision of 22 July 2002 establishing a framework programme on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (AGIS)</head>
      <p n="2">Council Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 22 July 2002</p>
      <p n="4">establishing a framework programme on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (AGIS)</p>
      <p n="5">(2002/630/JHA)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 30(1), Article 31 and Article 34(2)(c) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the initiative from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union states that the Union's objective is to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) The conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999 call for cooperation to be stepped up on preventing and fighting crime, including crime using new information and communication technologies, in order to achieve a genuine European area of justice. The importance of cooperation in this area has again been emphasised in the action plan entitled The prevention and control of organised crime: a European Union strategy for the beginning of the new millennium(3).</p>
      <p n="13">(3) Article 12 of the Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA of 15 March 2001 on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings(4) calls for cooperation between Member States in order to facilitate more effective protection of victims' interests in criminal proceedings.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) It is appropriate to widen the European dimension of projects to three Member States or to two Member States and an applicant country in order to promote the formation of partnerships and the exchange of information and good national practice.</p>
      <p n="15">(5) The Grotius II - Criminal(5), Stop II(6), Oisin II(7), Hippokrates(8) and Falcone(9) programmes, established by the Council, have helped to strengthen cooperation between the police and judiciary in the Member States and to improve mutual understanding of their police, judicial, legal and administrative systems.</p>
      <p n="16">(6) Following approval by the Feira European Council in June 2000 of the European Union Action Plan on Drugs (2000 to 2004), actions to combat drug trafficking are also included in this framework programme.</p>
      <p n="17">(7) The establishment of a single framework programme, expressly called for by the European Parliament and the Council when the previous programmes were adopted, will further boost cooperation by way of a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach involving the various persons responsible for preventing and combating crime at European Union level. In doing so, it is necessary to maintain a balanced approach between various activities aiming at the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
      <p n="18">(8) It is desirable to ensure the continuity of the activities supported by the framework programme, by providing for their coordination within a single frame of reference that rationalises procedures and improves management and economies of scale. Moreover, it is necessary to make full use of the operational benefits of the programme, in particular for law enforcement authorities, and to encourage cooperation between the Member States' law enforcement authorities and to provide such authorities with a greater insight into the working methods of their counterparts in other Member States and constraints by which they may be bound.</p>
      <p n="19">(9) The expenditure of the framework programme should be compatible with the current ceiling under Heading 3 of the financial perspective.</p>
      <p n="20">(10) The annual appropriations of the framework programme should be decided upon by the budgetary authority during the budgetary procedure.</p>
      <p n="21">(11) The framework programme needs to be made accessible to the applicant countries, as partners and participants in the projects funded under that programme. Where appropriate, participation of other States in that programme could also be envisaged.</p>
      <p n="22">(12) The measures required to implement this Decision should be adopted according to the procedures laid down in it, with the assistance of a Committee.</p>
      <p n="23">(13) To increase the added value of the projects implemented under this Decision, it is necessary to ensure consistency and complementarity between these projects and other forms of Community intervention.</p>
      <p n="24">(14) Regular monitoring and evaluation of the framework programme need to be ensured so that the effectiveness of the projects carried out can be assessed in the light of the objectives and so that the priorities can be re-adjusted if necessary.</p>
      <p n="25">(15) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(10), is included in this Decision for the entire duration of the framework programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="26">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="27">Article 1</p>
      <p n="28">Establishment of the framework programme</p>
      <p n="29">1. This Decision establishes a framework programme for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the context of the area of freedom, security and justice, hereafter referred to as the programme.</p>
      <p n="30">2. The programme is hereby established for the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2007 and may be extended beyond the latter date.</p>

      <p n="32">Programme objectives</p>
      <p n="33">1. The programme shall contribute to the general objective of providing European Union citizens with a high level of protection in an area of freedom, security and justice. In this context, it aims, in particular, to:</p>

      <p n="35">(b) promote and strengthen networking, mutual cooperation on general subjects of common interest to the Member States, the exchange and dissemination of information, experience and best practice, local and regional cooperation, and the improvement and adaptation of training and technical and scientific research;</p>
      <p n="36">(c) encourage Member States to step up cooperation with the applicant countries, other third countries and appropriate regional and international organisations.</p>
      <p n="37">2. The programme shall support projects in the following areas relating to Title VI of the Treaty on European Union:</p>

      <p n="50">(d) representatives of victim assistance services, including public departments responsible for immigration and social services.</p>
      <p n="51">4. Within the framework of the objectives laid down in Article 2, the programme may also cofinance:</p>

      <p n="53">(b) complementary measures such as seminars, meetings of experts or other activities to disseminate the results obtained under the programme.</p>

      <p n="67">(f) conferences and seminars.</p>
      <p n="68">Article 5</p>
      <p n="69">Financing the programme</p>

      <p n="71">The annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial perspective.</p>
      <p n="72">2. The cofinancing of a project by the programme shall be exclusive of any other financing by another programme financed by the general budget of the European Union.</p>
