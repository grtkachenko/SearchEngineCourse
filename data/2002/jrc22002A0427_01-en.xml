      <p n="43">6. Associate membership of the Group shall be open, with the agreement of the Council, to those organisations and entities not entitled to full membership under the provisions of paragraph 5 above.

      <p n="49">(e) In order to achieve the objectives listed in paragraph 3 above, the Council shall approve a work programme which shall be revised periodically.</p>
      <p n="50">Headquarters</p>

      <p n="52">Decision-making and distribution of votes</p>
      <p n="53">9. (a) Except where otherwise specified, and subject to the provisions of subparagraph (d) below, the Council, the Committee on Projects referred to in paragraph 10, and such committees and subsidiary bodies as may be established, shall wherever possible take decisions by consensus. Where no such consensus can be reached, any member may request that such a decision be taken by a simple majority vote, unless a special vote is specified.</p>
      <p n="54">(b) Each member shall be entitled to the number of votes allocated to it in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (c). In the case of voting, the European Community and member intergovernmental organisations shall vote with a number of votes equal to the total number of votes attributable to their Member States.</p>
      <p n="55">(c) All members shall together hold 2000 votes. Fifty per cent of the total votes of members shall be distributed equally among all members, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b). The remaining 50 % of the total votes shall be allocated to each member in proportion to its "coefficient of jute-related importance" (COJI) as defined in subparagraph (d). The total of the basic votes and the COJI-related votes of each member shall be appropriately rounded so that there are no fractional votes and the total number of votes of members does not exceed 2000, subject, however, to the provision of subparagraph (e).</p>
      <p n="56">(d) For the purposes of these Terms of Reference the "coefficient of jute-related importance" (COJI) of each member shall be its share in the total value attributed to all member countries in accordance with the following formulae:</p>
      <p n="57">(i) in the case of jute-producing countries, the weighted average volume of production of 40 % and the average volume of net trade of 60 % of jute and jute products over the most recent three-year period for which relevant statistics are available;</p>

      <p n="59">(e) No member representing a single country shall have more than 450 votes. Any votes over this figure arising from the methodology prescribed in subparagraphs (c) and (d), and provided for in subparagraph (i), shall be redistributed among all other members on the same basis of computation as provided for under those subparagraphs.</p>
      <p n="60">(f) If, for any reason, difficulties should arise in the determination of votes through the use of the methodology prescribed in subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e), the Group may, by special vote, decide on a different methodology for the distribution of votes.</p>

Such distribution of votes shall remain in effect for the full jute year, except as provided for in subparagraph (i).</p>
      <p n="63">(i) Whenever the membership of the Group changes or when any member has its voting rights suspended or restricted under any provisions of the rules of procedure, the Council shall re-distribute the votes of all other members in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. The Council shall decide the date on which the redistribution of votes shall become effective.</p>
      <p n="64">(j) A member authorised by another member to cast the votes held by the authorising member under this paragraph shall cast such votes in accordance with the instructions of the authorising member.</p>
      <p n="65">Committee on Projects (COP)</p>
      <p n="66">10. (a) The Council shall establish a Committee on Projects (COP), which shall be open to all members. The Committee may invite associate members and other interested parties to participate in its work.</p>

      <p n="68">(c) The Council may, in certain circumstances, delegate to the Committee on Projects its powers relating to the approval of projects and related activities. The Council shall establish rules governing such delegation of powers to the Committee on Projects.</p>
      <p n="69">Private Sector Consultative Board</p>
      <p n="70">11. (a) To facilitate interaction with the private sector, the Council shall establish a Private Sector Consultative Board (hereinafter referred to as the Consultative Board).
