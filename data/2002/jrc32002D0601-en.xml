      <p n="2">Council Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 27 June 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Decision 1999/311/EC adopting the third phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (Tempus III) (2000 to 2006)</p>
      <p n="5">(2002/601/EC)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),</p>
      <p n="11">Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="13">(1) On 23 July 1996 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1488/96 on financial and technical measures to accompany (MEDA) the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership(4).</p>
      <p n="14">(2) The Mediterranean region constitutes a priority area for the Community and the political, economic and social development of the Mediterranean partners is a challenge of ever increasing proportions.</p>
      <p n="15">(3) It is important to pursue and intensify the cooperation launched within the Euro-Mediterranean partnership which was established by the Barcelona declaration of 27 November 1995.</p>
      <p n="16">(4) The Barcelona declaration recognises that the traditions of culture and civilisation throughout the Mediterranean region, dialogue between these cultures and exchanges at human, scientific and technological level are an essential factor in bringing the Mediterranean peoples closer, promoting understanding between them and improving their perception of each other. It stresses the essential nature of the development of human resources, both as regards the education and training of young people in particular, and in the area of culture, and recognises the essential contribution civil society can make in the process of development of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and as an essential factor for greater understanding and closeness between peoples.</p>
      <p n="17">(5) Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in higher education is an indispensable instrument to achieve the key objectives set out in the Barcelona declaration and in particular to develop human resources, promote understanding between cultures and rapprochement of the peoples in the Euro-Mediterranean region as well as to develop free and flourishing civil societies.</p>
      <p n="18">(6) On 29 April 1999 the Council adopted Decision 1999/311/EC adopting the third phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (Tempus III) (2000 to 2006)(5).</p>
      <p n="19">(7) The Tempus III programme has proved an effective tool for structural cooperation in, and development of, higher education including the improvement of human resources and occupational skills. Via universities and university staff it can also make an effective contribution to the development of public administration and education structures in the eligible countries.</p>
      <p n="20">(8) Enlarging the geographical scope of the Tempus III programme to the Mediterranean non-member countries and territories referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1488/96 would make it possible to build on the proven strengths of that programme, achieve economies of scale and favour regional cooperation around the wider Euro-Mediterranean region.</p>
      <p n="21">(9) It is appropriate to extend the period covered by the Tempus III programme by six months to 31 December 2006 without adjusting the financial provision, since that period corresponds to that of the financial perspectives as well as that of the other major Community education and training programmes.</p>
      <p n="22">(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of the Tempus III programme should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).</p>
      <p n="23">(11) Decision 1999/311/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="24">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="25">Article 1</p>
      <p n="26">Decision 1999/311/EC is hereby amended as follows:</p>
