      <p n="10">(2) The Parties agreed in Protocol 2 to the Interim Agreement on steel products, to establish, immediately upon the entry into force of the said Agreement, a double-checking system, without quantitative limits, for the import into the Community of steel products originating in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>

      <p n="16">3. From the date of entry into force of the Interim Agreement and until further notice, imports into the Community of steel products originating in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as listed in Annex I shall also be subject to the issue of an export document by the competent authorities of the exporting country. The importer shall present the original of the export document not later than 31 March of the year following that in which the goods covered by the document were shipped.</p>
      <p n="17">4. Shipment shall be considered to have taken place on the date of loading on to the exporting means of transport.</p>
      <p n="18">5. The export document shall conform to the model shown in Annex II. It shall be valid for exports throughout the customs territory of the Community.</p>

      <p n="50">Article 5</p>
      <p n="51">The notification provided for in this Regulation shall be given to the Commission of the European Communities (DG Trade E/2 and DG Enterprise E/2).</p>
      <p n="52">Article 6</p>
      <p n="53">Regulation (EC) No 190/98 is hereby repealed.</p>
