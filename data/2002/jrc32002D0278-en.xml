      <p n="3">of 10 April 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Decision 2001/393/EC as regards the certification for the import of specified pathogen-free eggs from third countries</p>

      <p n="7">(2002/278/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs(1), as last amended by Commission Decision 2001/867/EC(2), and in particular Article 23(2), Article 24(2) and Article 27a thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Commission Decision 2001/393/EC(3) lays down animal health conditions and veterinary certification for the import of specified pathogen-free eggs from third countries and draws up a list of third countries from which Member States authorise imports of such eggs.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) The validity period of the animal health certificate has been fixed at five days.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Transport and logistical difficulties have caused problems in delivering pathogen-free eggs to Member States prior to the date of expiry of the validity of the animal health certificate.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) There is a low risk of contamination of this product during transport when packaged and transported in accordance with the requirements of Decision 2001/393/EC. An extension of the validity period of the certificate to 15 days would not jeopardise the health status of such a product.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) Decision 2001/393/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
      <p n="18">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="19">Article 1</p>
      <p n="20">Annex II to Decision 2001/393/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>
      <p n="22">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
