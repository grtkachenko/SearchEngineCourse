      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2580/2000(2), and in particular Article 7(4) thereof,</p>

The duties resulting from the measures provided in this Regulation should not exceed those applicable under the Common Customs Tariff.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) Commission Regulations (EC) No 1475/2000 of 10 July 2000 determining the amounts of the agricultural components and the additional duties applicable from 1 July 2000 on the importation into the Community of goods covered by Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 from Iceland(6) and (EC) No 1476/2000 of 10 July 2000 determining the amounts of the agricultural components and the additional duties applicable from 1 July 2000 on the importation into the Community of goods covered by Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 from Norway(7) should accordingly be repealed.</p>

      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">Regulations (EC) No 1475/2000 and (EC) No 1476/2000 are repealed.</p>

      <p n="21">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="22">It shall apply from 1 January 2002.</p>
      <p n="23">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
