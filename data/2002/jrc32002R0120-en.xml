      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>

      <p n="20">It shall apply from 1 January 2002.</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="22">Done at Brussels, 21 January 2002.</p>
