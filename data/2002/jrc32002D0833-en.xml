      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products(1), as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC(2), and in particular Article 11(5) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Commission Decision 2000/672/EC of 20 October 2000 laying down special conditions governing imports of fishery products originating in Venezuela(3), states that the "Servicio Autonomo de Recursos Pesqueros (SARPA) of the Ministerio de Agricultura y Cria" is to be the competent authority in Venezuela for verifying and certifying compliance of fishery and aquaculture products with the requirements of Directive 91/493/EEC.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Following a restructuring of the Venezuelan administration, the competent authority for issuing health certificates for fishery products has changed to the "Instituto Nacional de la Pesca y Acuacultura (INAPESCA)". This new authority is capable of effectively verifying the application of the laws in force.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Decision 2000/672/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>

      <p n="21">2. In Article 3, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following: "2. Certificates must bear the name, capacity and signature of the representative of the Inapesca and the latter's official stamp in a colour different from that of other endorsements".</p>
      <p n="22">3. Annex A is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 2</p>
      <p n="24">This Decision shall apply from 7 December 2002.</p>
