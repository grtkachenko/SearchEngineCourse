      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 778/2002</p>
      <p n="3">of 7 May 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the grant of aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder intended for animal feed and the sale of such skimmed-milk powder</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 509/2002(2), and in particular Articles 10 and 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 213/2001(4), is a recasting of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1725/79 of 26 July 1979 on the rules for granting aid to skimmed milk processed into compound feedingstuffs and skimmed-milk powder intended for feed for calves(5). Under the terms of Article 1(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1725/79 and in line with its practical application, mixtures intended for the manufacture of compound feedingstuffs contain skimmed-milk powder to which one or more ingredients listed in that paragraph may be added. In order to remove any doubt concerning the interpretation of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999, which lays down composition requirements for the mixtures, that practical application by the Member States should be confirmed and the Article should therefore be retroactively clarified.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,</p>
      <p n="11">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="12">Article 1</p>
      <p n="13">In Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999, point (a) is replaced by the following: "(a) skimmed-milk powder and, as the case may be,".</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="16">It shall apply from 1 January 2000.</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="18">Done at Brussels, 7 May 2002.</p>
      <p n="19">For the Commission</p>
