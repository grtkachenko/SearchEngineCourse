      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1368/2002</p>
      <p n="3">of 26 July 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 509/2002(2), and in particular Article 26(3) and Article 31(14) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1166/2002(4), lays down special detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1587/96(6), as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products. In order to ensure that the export refund arrangements are properly managed and reduce the risk of speculative applications and disruption to the arrangements for certain milk products, there is a need to depart from Article 35(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(8), which limits the portion of the security to be forfeit where the trader returns the licence before the end of the validity period.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 1151/2002 of 27 June 2002 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Estonia(9) introduces concessions in the form of reciprocal tariff quotas involving the abolition of Community refunds on certain milk products. Similar concessions have been agreed with Latvia and Lithuania. Refunds on the products concerned were consequently abolished in the case of the three Baltic countries as from 4 July 2002. In order to avoid disrupting trade with these countries and guarantee that only products which have not benefited from refunds are exported to them, specific arrangements for the issue of licences to these countries should be drawn up as soon as possible. To that end, the provisions applicable to Poland by virtue of Article 20b of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 should also apply to the countries and products concerned.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 lays down the validity period of export licences. Article 18(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1253/2002(11), establishes the rate of refund to be paid in cases where the destination indicated on the licence has not been complied with. In order to comply with the concessions granted, the necessary steps should be taken to prevent licences issued for other third countries from being used to export to those countries to which concessions have been granted, and to allow licences to be cancelled and the securities lodged to be released.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,</p>
