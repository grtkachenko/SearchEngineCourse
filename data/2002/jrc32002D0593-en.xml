      <p n="14">(3) The Dutch authorities and the authorities of the United Kingdom have indicated to the Commission that, on preliminary examination, the dossiers for the active substances concerned appear to satisfy the data and information requirements of Annex II to Directive 91/414/EC. The dossiers submitted appear also to satisfy the data and information requirements of Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC in respect of one plant-protection product containing the active substance concerned. In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EC, the dossiers were subsequently forwarded by the respective applicants to the Commission and other Member States, and were referred to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.</p>

      <p n="21">The dossiers also satisfy the data and information requirements set out in Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC in respect of one plant protection product containing the active substance, taking into account the uses proposed.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 2</p>
      <p n="23">The rapporteur Member States shall pursue the detailed examination for the dossiers concerned and shall report the conclusions of their examinations accompanied by any recommendations on the inclusion or non-inclusion of the active substance concerned in Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC and any conditions related thereto to the Commission as soon as possible and at the latest within a period of one year from the date of publication of this Decision in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
