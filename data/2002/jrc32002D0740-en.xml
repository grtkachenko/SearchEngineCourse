      <p n="2">Commission Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 3 September 2002</p>
      <p n="4">establishing revised ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to bed mattresses and amending Decision 98/634/EC</p>
      <p n="5">(notified under document number C(2002) 3293)</p>
      <p n="6">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="7">(2002/740/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 the Community eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria are to be established according to product groups.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) It also provides that the review of the eco-label criteria, as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to the criteria, is to take place in due time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for each product group. That review is to result in a proposal for prolongation, withdrawal or revision.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) It is appropriate to revise the ecological criteria that were established by Commission Decision 98/634/EC of 2 October 1998 establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to bed mattresses(2) in order to reflect the developments in the market. At the same time, the period of validity of that Decision as extended by Commission Decision 2001/540/EC(3) and the definition of the product group should be amended.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) A new Commission Decision should be adopted establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of five years.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than 18 months, both the new criteria established by this Decision and the criteria established by Decision 98/634/EC should be valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies that have been awarded or that have applied for the award of the eco-label for their products prior to the date of application of this Decision to adapt those products to comply with the new criteria.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are based on the draft criteria developed by the European Union Eco-Labelling Board established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,</p>
      <p n="20">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="21">Article 1</p>
      <p n="22">In order to be awarded the Community eco-label under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, a bed mattress must fall within the product group "bed mattresses" as defined in Article 2, and must comply with the ecological criteria set out in the Annex to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 2</p>
      <p n="24">1. The product group "bed mattresses" shall comprise:</p>
      <p n="25">(a) bed mattresses within the meaning of paragraph 2;</p>
      <p n="26">(b) latex foam for use in bed mattresses;</p>
      <p n="27">(c) polyurethane foam for use in bed mattresses.</p>
      <p n="28">2. "Bed mattresses" means products providing a surface to sleep or rest upon, consisting of a strong cloth cover filled with materials, and that can be placed on an existing supporting bed structure.</p>
      <p n="29">This includes framed sprung mattresses, which are defined as an upholstered bed base consisting of springs, topped with fillings, on a rigid frame to be used in a bed frame or free standing, combined with a mattress pad which is not intended to be used separately.</p>
      <p n="30">Inflatable mattresses and water mattresses are excluded.</p>
      <p n="31">Article 3</p>
      <p n="32">For administrative purposes the code number assigned to the product group "bed mattresses" shall be "014".</p>
      <p n="33">Article 4</p>
      <p n="34">Article 3 of Decision 98/634/EC is replaced by the following: "Article 3</p>
      <p n="35">The product group definition and the specific ecological criteria for the product group shall be valid until 31 January 2004."</p>
      <p n="36">Article 5</p>
      <p n="37">This Decision shall apply from 1 September 2002 until 31 August 2007.</p>
      <p n="38">Producers of products falling within the product group "bed mattresses" which have already been awarded the eco-label before 1 September 2002 may continue to use that label until 31 January 2004.</p>
      <p n="39">Producers of products falling within the product group "bed mattresses" which have already applied for the award of the eco-label before 1 September 2002 may be awarded the eco-label under the terms of Decision 98/634/EC. In these cases the label may be used until 31 January 2004.</p>
      <p n="40">Article 6</p>
      <p n="41">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="42">Done at Brussels, 3 September 2002.</p>

      <p n="53">- limiting the use of eco-toxic compounds,</p>
      <p n="54">- limiting the levels of toxic residues,</p>
      <p n="55">- promoting a more durable product.</p>
      <p n="56">The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of bed mattresses which have a lower environmental impact.</p>
      <p n="57">Assessment and verification requirements</p>
      <p n="58">The specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion.</p>
      <p n="59">Where the applicant is required to provide declarations, documentation, analyses, test reports, or other evidence to show compliance with the criteria, it is understood that these may originate from the applicant and/or his supplier(s) and/or their supplier(s), etc., as appropriate.</p>
      <p n="60">Test reports shall be made by independent (third party) laboratories. However, the competent body assessing the application may exceptionally accept test reports from suitably accredited in-house laboratories.</p>
      <p n="61">Where appropriate, test methods other than those indicated for each criterion may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body assessing the application.</p>
      <p n="62">Where appropriate, competent bodies may require supporting documentation and may carry out independent verifications.</p>
      <p n="63">The competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or EN ISO14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria (Note: it is not required to implement such management schemes.).</p>
      <p n="64">Note:</p>
      <p n="65">Specific criteria are set for the following materials: latex foam, polyurethane foam, wire and springs, coconut fibres, wood and textile fibres and fabrics. Other materials for which no material specific criteria are set are allowed.
