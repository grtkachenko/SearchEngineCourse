      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/2002</p>
      <p n="3">of 22 August 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 as regards the detailed rules for applying the quota buy-back programme in the raw tobacco sector</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 546/2002(2), and in particular Article 14a thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Article 35(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 as regards the premium scheme, production quotas and the specific aid to be granted to producer groups in the raw tobacco sector(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1005/2002(4), provides, as part of the quota buy-back procedure, for a period running from 1 September to 31 December during which the Member State makes public producers' intentions to sell their quotas, so that other producers might buy them before they are permanently bought back.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Experience has shown that this four-month period is too long and so should be halved, thereby speeding up the buy-back procedure and making it more attractive to the producers, since the period of uncertainty regarding the conclusion of the sales procedure is also thus shortened.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) As the period to be amended begins on 1 September, this Regulation must enter into force immediately.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Tobacco,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="16">(a) The reference to "1 September" in Article 35(1) and (2) is replaced by "1 November";</p>
      <p n="17">(b) Article 35(3) is replaced by the following: "3. Once the two-month period laid down in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 is over, any quotas which have not been bought by producers shall be permanently bought back."</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Done at Brussels, 22 August 2002.</p>
      <p n="22">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="23">Franz Fischler</p>
      <p n="24">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="25">(1) OJ L 215, 30.7.1992, p. 70.</p>
      <p n="26">(2) OJ L 84, 28.3.2002, p. 4.</p>
      <p n="27">(3) OJ L 358, 31.12.1998, p. 17.</p>
