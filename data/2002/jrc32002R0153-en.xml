      <p n="2">Council Regulation (EC) No 153/2002</p>
      <p n="3">of 21 January 2002</p>
      <p n="4">on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) The Council is in the process of concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part, which was signed in Luxembourg on 9 April 2001 (hereinafter referred to as "the Stabilisation and Association Agreement").</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Meanwhile on 9 April 2001 the Council has concluded an Interim Agreement between the European Community and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia(1) which provides for the early entry into force of the trade and trade-related provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Interim Agreement").</p>
      <p n="11">(3) It is necessary to lay down the procedures for the application of certain provisions of these Agreements.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement stipulate that certain products originating in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia may be imported into the Community, within the limits of tariff quotas, at a reduced customs duty. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions for the calculation of the reduced rates of customs duties.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement already specify the products eligible for those tariff measures, the relevant volumes (and increases thereof), the applicable duties, periods of application and any eligibility criteria.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) Council or Commission Decisions amending the Combined Nomenclature and TARIC codes do not entail any substantive changes.</p>
      <p n="15">(7) In the interest of simplicity and of timely publication of Regulations implementing Community tariff quotas, provision should be made for the Commission, assisted by the Committee provided for in Article 42 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(2), to adopt the Regulations opening up and providing for the administration of the tariff quotas for "baby beef" products.</p>
      <p n="16">(8) Provision should be made for the Commission, assisted by the Committee set up by Article 248a of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(3), to adopt the Regulations opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas which might be granted as a result of negotiations on further tariff concessions pursuant to Article 29 of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and of Article 16 of the Interim Agreement.</p>
      <p n="17">(9) Duties should be totally suspended where preferential treatment results in ad valorem duties of 1 % or less, or in specific duties of EUR 1 or less.</p>
      <p n="18">(10) This Regulation should be applied retroactively and will continue to apply upon the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
      <p n="19">(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4),</p>
