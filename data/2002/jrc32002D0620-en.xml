      <p n="61">The Bureau of the European Parliament</p>
      <p n="62">1. has authorised its President to sign the decision of the institutions establishing the European Communities Personnel Selection Office (the "Office"), and its Secretary-General to sign the two subsidiary decisions concerning its operations;</p>
      <p n="63">2. affirms that the institutional autonomy of the European Parliament is not affected by the creation of the Office, in so far as it will remain exclusively competent for the recruitment of permanent officials, in accordance with its institutional interests, from the reserve lists drawn up by the Office;</p>
      <p n="64">3. recalls that the selection and recruitment of other categories of staff, in particular the staff of the political groups, remains the exclusive competence of the European Parliament, except in so far as it may seek the technical assistance of the Office in this respect;</p>
      <p n="65">4. recalls likewise that the organisation of internal competitions, permitting the passage of officials from one category to another, remains the exclusive responsibility of the European Parliament; reiterates its intention periodically to organise internal competitions for the different staff categories;</p>
      <p n="66">5. confirms its commitment to a multilingual and multicultural administration which is balanced from a linguistic and geographical point of view; gives notice that the capacity of the Office to provide reserve lists such as to allow a recruitment policy ensuring such balance is one of the main criteria on which its performance will be judged;</p>
      <p n="67">6. further gives notice that, in the event of the Office not being able to provide reserve lists sufficient to guarantee linguistic and geographical balance, the European Parliament reserves its right autonomously to organise specific selection competitions to redress the situation in accordance with Article 2 of the Decision establishing the Office;</p>
      <p n="68">7. recalls its decision of 8 April to instruct Parliament's representatives on the Management Board of the Office not to approve the use of age limits in the organisation of open selection competitions.</p>
