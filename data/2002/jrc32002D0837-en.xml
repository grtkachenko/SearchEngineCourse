      <p n="59">ANNEX I</p>
      <p n="60">SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES AND BROAD LINES OF THE ACTIVITIES</p>
      <p n="61">1. Introduction</p>
      <p n="62">As the source of 35 % of the electricity produced in the European Union, nuclear energy is an element of the debate on how to combat climate change and reduce the energy dependency of the European Union. However significant challenges need to be faced. Controlled thermonuclear fusion is one of the long term options for energy supply, in particular for the centralised supply of base-load electricity. The priority is to make progress towards demonstrating the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy and assessing its sustainable qualities. In the short term, ways of dealing with nuclear waste that are both safe and acceptable to society need to be found, and more particularly the implementation of technical solutions for the management of long-lived waste. Innovative concepts for the safer exploitation of nuclear fission should also be studied as possible contributions to meeting European energy needs in the decades ahead. The high standards of radiation protection in the Community must be maintained through focused and coordinated research, in particular into the effects of low levels of exposure.</p>
      <p n="63">Cooperation at European level, including the exchange of scientists and common research programmes, is already well established in this field. In respect of nuclear waste, radiation protection and other activities, this will be intensified and deepened at programme and project level in order to make better use of resources (both human resources and experimental facilities) and promote a common European view on key problems and approaches, in accordance with the needs of the European research area. Links will be established with national programmes and networking will be promoted with third countries, in particular, USA, the Newly Independent States of the Former Soviet Union (NIS), Canada and Japan. In the case of fusion, the Community, the Member States and Countries Associated with the activities covered by the Euratom Framework Programme will continue to work within the framework of an integrated programme of activities.</p>
      <p n="64">Coordination will be assured with the JRC programme on "nuclear safety and safeguards".</p>
      <p n="65">2. Priority thematic areas</p>
      <p n="66">2.1. Fusion energy research</p>
      <p n="67">Objectives</p>
      <p n="68">Fusion energy could contribute in the second half of the century to the emission-free large-scale production of base-load electricity. The advances made in fusion energy research justify further pursuing a vigorous effort towards the long-term objective of a fusion power plant. Theoretical work and experimental studies on the existing devices world-wide, in particular on JET, have established the scientific and technical readiness for the construction of a project of the next generation after JET with the objective of demonstrating the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy. World wide collaboration on fusion energy research has progressed to the detailed engineering design of such a Next Step device, ITER, with the objectives of extended burn in inductive operation with power amplification Q &gt;10, demonstrating generation of 400 MW of fusion power over about 400 seconds, that could allow burning plasmas to be studied in conditions relevant to energy production.</p>
      <p n="69">The successful completion of the ITER Engineering Design Activities makes it possible, in line with the reactor orientation of the Community activities on fusion energy research, to take a decision about the realisation of the Next Step. Subject to a positive outcome of the international negotiations on the legal and institutional conditions of the establishment of an ITER Legal Entity and negotiations for its joint implementation (construction, operation, exploitation and decommissioning), a specific decision could be sought in the period 2003-2004, so that construction could effectively start during the period 2005-2006. The period 2003-2006 has therefore to be seen as a transition period marked by the need to rationalise European activities due to the strong orientation of the programme towards the Next Step.</p>
      <p n="70">If and when decided, the realisation of the Next Step will mobilise significant human and financial resources. Once a decision is taken to go ahead with the project, adaptations to the current efforts of the European partners of Euratom in the field of fusion and organisational changes will be required, in particular to steer jointly the European contribution to ITER. The continuation of a meaningful R&amp; D programme will be ensured, including the transition between the activities currently carried out in the framework of the Associations(1) and JET, and what would become the "accompanying programme" in physics and technology for fusion once the construction of the Next Step/ITER device, if decided, has reached its steady state after 2006.</p>
      <p n="71">Priorities</p>
      <p n="72">(i) Associations' programme in physics and technology</p>
      <p n="73">The Associations' programme will include:</p>
      <p n="74">- R&amp; D in fusion physics and plasma engineering, focusing on the preparation of ITER operation and the study and evaluation of toroidal magnetic confinement formulas, with in particular the continuation of the construction of the Wendelstein 7-X "stellarator" and operation of the existing installations in the Euratom Associations.</p>
      <p n="75">- Structured R&amp; D activities in fusion technology in particular research on fusion materials and participation in the R&amp; D activities for the decommissioning of JET, which is foreseen at the end of its operations.</p>
      <p n="76">- Investigations of socio-economic aspects, focusing on evaluation of economic costs and social acceptability of fusion energy, by way of complement to the further studies on safety and environmental aspects; coordination, in the context of a keep-in-touch activity, of the Member States' civil research activities on inertial confinement and possible alternative concepts; dissemination of results and the diffusion of information to the public; mobility and training.</p>
      <p n="77">In contributing to the Associations' programme, priority will be given to multilateral actions to focalise activities on common projects such as those directly related to operation on JET and to the Next Step/ITER and/or staff training. Depending on a decision on the realisation of ITER and its timing, the current Community support to the Associations activities will be adjusted, and the phasing out of the exploitation of a number of facilities will be considered. Adequate means shall be ensured to maintain a strong European coordination of the fusion activities, which has demonstrated its usefulness over the years.</p>
      <p n="78">The extent of the accompanying domestic programme in fusion physics and technology which is required in the Associations and European industry to take full benefit from ITER, will depend (a) on the level of the European share in ITER and (b) on where would be sited. This could entail investments aiming at maintaining experimentation on fusion devices at world-class level in Europe beyond the start of operation of ITER and an adequate programme of technological development.</p>
      <p n="79">(ii) Exploitation of the JET facilities</p>
      <p n="80">The JET facilities will continue to be exploited in the framework of the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA), in view of preparing the ITER operation by completing the exploitation of the performance enhancements currently under way. The use of the JET facilities should be phased out progressively according to the schedule of the ITER realisation and to the availability of the necessary financial resources.</p>
      <p n="81">(iii) Next Step/ITER</p>
      <p n="82">The Proposal for the Euratom framework programme (2002-2006) includes the continuation of Next Step activities with a view to participating in its construction in the second half of the period. However, since decisions on ITER do not depend only upon European Union Institutions but also on the European Union international partners, the proposed programme of activities must be open regarding the eventual siting and framework of the Next Step/ITER and the precise content of the accompanying domestic programme. The studies performed in preparation of possible European site(s) will be completed.</p>
      <p n="83">The European Union participation in ITER would include contributions to the construction of equipment and installations, which are within the perimeter of the ITER site and necessary for its exploitation, as well as to the costs associated with the staffing and management of, and the support to be given to, the project during construction. The level and nature of this participation will depend on the outcome of the negotiations with the European Union international partners, and in turn on the location of the ITER site. If ITER was located in Europe, the European Union participation would also include contribution to the costs to be borne by Europe as a Host Party.</p>
      <p n="84">2.2. Management of radioactive waste</p>
      <p n="85">Objectives</p>
      <p n="86">The absence of a broadly agreed approach to waste management and disposal is one of the main impediments to the continued and future use of nuclear energy. In particular, this applies to the management and disposal of long-lived waste components in geological repositories, which will be required no matter what treatment method is chosen for the spent fuel and high level waste. Research alone cannot ensure societal acceptance; however, it is needed in order to develop and test the repository technologies, investigate suitable sites, promote basic scientific understanding relating to safety and safety assessment methods, and to develop decision processes that are perceived as fair and equitable by the stakeholders involved.</p>
      <p n="87">Research is also needed to explore the technical and economic potential of concepts for nuclear energy generation able to make better use of fissile material and generate less waste and of partitioning and transmutation to reduce the hazard of the waste, on an industrial scale.</p>
      <p n="88">Research Priorities</p>
      <p n="89">(i) Research on geological disposal</p>
      <p n="90">The aims are to establish a sound technical basis for demonstrating the safety of disposing spent fuel and long lived radioactive wastes in geological formations and underpin the development of a common European view on the main issues related to the management and disposal of waste.</p>
      <p n="91">- Improvement of fundamental knowledge, developing and testing technologies: research will focus on key physical, chemical and biological processes; interaction between the different natural and engineered barriers, their long-term stability and means of implementing disposal technologies in underground research laboratories.</p>
      <p n="92">- New and improved tools: research will focus on models for performance, and safety assessment, and methodologies to demonstrate long term safety, including sensitivity and uncertainty analyses, and development and evaluation of alternative measures of performance and of better governance processes that properly address public concerns on waste disposal.</p>
      <p n="93">(ii) Partitioning and transmutation and other concepts to produce less waste in nuclear energy generation</p>
      <p n="94">The aims are to determine practical ways of reducing the amount and/or hazard of the waste to be disposed of by partitioning and transmutation and to explore the potential of concepts for nuclear energy to produce less waste.</p>
      <p n="95">- Partitioning and transmutation: research will focus on fundamental assessments of the overall concept; demonstration at small scale of the most promising partitioning technologies; further development of technologies for transmutation; and evaluation of their industrial practicability.</p>
      <p n="96">- Concepts to produce less waste: research will focus on exploring the potential for the more efficient use of fissile material in existing reactors and of other concepts to produce less waste in nuclear energy generation.</p>
      <p n="97">2.3. Radiation protection</p>
      <p n="98">Objectives</p>
      <p n="99">Radiation is used extensively in medicine and industry (including the generation of nuclear energy) and its safety is predicated on a sound radiation protection policy and its effective implementation. Community research underpins European policy and has contributed to the high levels of protection achieved in practice. These standards must be maintained and, in some cases, improved and research has a key role in this process. The main objective is to resolve uncertainties in the risk from exposures to radiation at low and protracted doses (ie, at levels typically encountered by the population and in workplaces) which remains a controversial scientific and policy issue, and has important implications for the use of radiation in both medicine and industry. Community research in other areas will focus on making better use of national efforts, principally through their more effective integration by networking and targeted research where this would either be complementary to, or provide synergy with, national programmes.</p>
      <p n="100">Research priorities</p>
      <p n="101">- Quantification of risks associated with low and protracted exposure: research will focus on epidemiological studies of suitable exposed populations, and on cellular and molecular biology research on the interaction between radiation and the DNA, cells, organs and the body.</p>
      <p n="102">- Medical exposure and natural sources of radiation: enhancing the safety and efficacy of medical uses of radiation; better understanding, assessment and management of natural sources, in particular, naturally occurring radioactive materials.</p>
      <p n="103">- Protection of the environment and radioecology: conceptual and methodological basis for protection of the environment; better assessment and management of the impact of natural and artificial sources of radiation on man and the environment.</p>
      <p n="104">- Risk and emergency management: better approaches for risk governance; more effective and coherent emergency management in Europe, including rehabilitation of contaminated areas.</p>
      <p n="105">- Protection of the workplace: improved monitoring and management of occupational exposure in industries involving exposure to radiation.</p>
      <p n="106">3. Other activities in the field of nuclear technologies and safety</p>
      <p n="107">Objectives</p>
      <p n="108">The objectives are to support European Union policies in the fields of health, energy and the environment, to ensure that European capability is maintained at a high level in relevant fields not covered by the thematic priorities and to contribute towards the creation of the European Research Area.</p>
      <p n="109">Research priorities</p>
      <p n="110">(i) Innovative concepts</p>
      <p n="111">The aims are to evaluate the potential of innovative concepts and develop improved and safer processes in the field of nuclear energy. Research will focus on:</p>
      <p n="112">- Evaluation of the potential of innovative concepts and development of improved and safer processes for the generation and exploitation of nuclear energy that have been identified as offering longer term benefits in terms of safety, environmental impact, resource utilisation, proliferation resistance or diversity of application.</p>
      <p n="113">(ii) Education and training</p>
      <p n="114">The aim is to better integrate European education and training in nuclear safety and radiation protection to combat the decline in both student numbers and teaching establishments, thus providing the necessary competence and expertise for the continued safe use of nuclear energy and other uses of radiation in industry and medicine. Support will focus on:</p>
      <p n="115">- development of a more harmonised approach for education in the nuclear sciences and engineering in Europe and its implementation, including better integration of national resources and capabilities.</p>
      <p n="116">This will be complemented by support for fellowships, special training courses, training networks, grants for young research workers from the NIS and CEE countries, and transnational access to infrastructure. As regards infrastructures, transnational access to installations will be promoted. A further step will be to initiate a common analysis of the future European Union needs in human resources and competencies and experimental tools in the mid-term.</p>
      <p n="117">(iii) Safety of existing nuclear installations</p>
      <p n="118">The aim is to improve safety in existing nuclear installations in Member States and candidate countries during their remaining operational lifetimes and subsequent decommissioning, making use of the considerable knowledge and experience gained internationally from experimental and theoretical research. Research will focus on:</p>
      <p n="119">- plant management including effects of ageing and fuel performance; severe accident management, including the development of advanced numerical simulation codes; integration of European capabilities and knowledge from practical decommissioning; developing scientific bases for safety and best practice, at a European level.</p>
      <p n="120">(1) Established under contracts of associations between the Community and entities in the Members States and in countries associated to the EURATOM framework programme.</p>
