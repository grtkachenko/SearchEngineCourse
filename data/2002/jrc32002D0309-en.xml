      <p n="11">Having regard to the assent of the European Parliament(1),</p>
      <p n="12">Having regard to the approval of the Council,</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="14">(1) In order to pursue the privileged links between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation and their common desire to widen and strengthen their relations, the following agreements were signed on 21 June 1999 and should be approved:</p>
