      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1113/2002</p>
      <p n="3">of 26 June 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing the provisions concerning the certificate of inspection for imports from third countries under Article 11 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 473/2002(2), and in particular Article 11(3)(b) and (4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001(3) establishes a new certificate of inspection for imported products replacing the certificate established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3457/92(4) and foresees that the new certificate shall be applied from 1 July 2002 to products imported under the procedures established in Article 11(1) and 11(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) However, preparing for 1 July 2002, several Member States have encountered certain technical difficulties and doubts to implement Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001. For the sake of transparency and in order to avoid confusion, these problems must be solved prior to applying the new certificate.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) It is therefore advisable to postpone the date from which the new certificate established in Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 shall apply.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 is amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="16">1. In Article 8, the date of "1 July 2002" is replaced by "1 November 2002".</p>
      <p n="17">2. In Article 9, the date of "1 July 2002" is replaced by "1 November 2002".</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Done at Brussels, 26 June 2002.</p>
