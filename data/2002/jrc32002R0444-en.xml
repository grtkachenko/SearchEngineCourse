      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 444/2002</p>
      <p n="3">of 11 March 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code and Regulations (EC) No 2787/2000 and (EC) No 993/2001</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(1), as last amended by European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 2700/2000(2) (hereinafter: "the Code"), and in particular Article 247 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Certain definitions set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 993/2001(4), require updating.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Under the common commercial policy it is frequently necessary to amend the list of countries and territories qualifying for autonomous Community tariff preferences and consequently to amend the list in Section 2 of Part I, Title IV, Chapter 2, of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) The heading and wording of Section 2 should therefore be based not on an exhaustive list of those countries and territories, but on a general reference to "beneficiary countries or territories", since the latter are duly listed in the Council regulations granting the preferences.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) In certain circumstances it is possible to have defective goods repaired outside the customs territory of the Community without incurring a customs debt on reimportation.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) After release for free circulation, the price agreed between buyer and seller can be subject in certain cases to modification in order to take account of the defective nature of goods.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) Consequently, the rules in force should expressly allow a transaction value under Article 29 of the Code to take account of those special circumstances, with appropriate safeguards and subject to the application of reasonable time limits.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) The purpose of Article 167(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 was to avoid the levying of customs duties on software imported on carrier media. That objective has since been achieved by the Agreement on trade in information technology products (ITA), approved by Council Decision 97/359/EC(5). Without prejudice to the application of GATT Decision 4.1 of 12 May 1995, it is therefore no longer necessary to provide special implementing provisions for the determination of the customs value of carrier media.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) The threshold limit, specified in Article 179(1)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, for presentation of the declaration of particulars relating to customs value (value declaration) should be raised to EUR 10000 to take into account monetary changes and to simplify import formalities.</p>
      <p n="18">(9) Certain adjustments and corrections are required to the provisions on end-use, in particular to clarify them and to align them with the rules for the customs procedures with economic impact.</p>
      <p n="19">(10) The provisions on Community transit laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 have been the subject of a complete and thorough review that has led to the revision of a substantial part of the provisions. Since then, it has been found that the amended provisions contain certain inadequacies and inaccuracies, which need to be remedied.</p>
      <p n="20">(11) For the protection of the financial interests of the other Contracting Parties to the Convention on a common transit procedure, approved by Council Decision 87/415/EEC(6), it should be ensured that an appropriate guarantee is furnished where a transit operation concerning Community goods involves their territory. The guarantee should be calculated as if the goods were non-Community goods.</p>
      <p n="21">(12) Where the principal wishes to use the comprehensive guarantee certificate for all goods, the criteria concerning the use of the comprehensive guarantee for goods involving higher risk of fraud should apply to all goods.</p>
      <p n="22">(13) In order to ensure the uniform application of the customs rules within the Community, provisions should be inserted concerning the import duties to be charged on import goods which receive a favourable tariff treatment by reason of their end-use. This should be done for clarification reasons. The insertion should have retroactive effect because similar provisions already existed until 30 June 2001, notably in Article 52 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2228/91(7), which was repealed by Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, and in Article 585a of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, before it was amended by Regulation (EC) No 993/2001.</p>
      <p n="23">(14) Article 859 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 contains a list of cases in which no customs debt is incurred, even in one of the situations referred to in Article 204(1)(a) or (b) of the Code.</p>
      <p n="24">(15) That list should be adapted so that it covers cases of non-compliance with certain obligations applicable to goods under a Community transit procedure, where those goods are presented intact at the office of destination.</p>
      <p n="25">(16) The list should also cover cases of non-compliance with certain rules on transfers, applicable to goods placed under a suspensive procedure or to goods benefiting from a favourable treatment on account of their end-use, where those goods arrive at the specified destination.</p>
      <p n="26">(17) Since the amendment of Article 859 is linked to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 993/2001, which has applied since 1 July 2001, it is appropriate to make that amendment applicable from the same date.</p>
      <p n="27">(18) In order to rationalise management of the deadlines for examining applications for waiver of post-clearance entry in the accounts under Article 220(2)(b) of the Code or for repayment or remission of duty under Article 239 thereof, the suspension of the period for examining such applications where the person concerned is consulted in accordance with Articles 872a or 906a of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should be fixed at one month in all cases.</p>
      <p n="28">(19) In order to ensure a consistent interpretation of the provisions concerning the designation of the office of destination for the control of the use and/or destination of goods, it is necessary to specify the office at which the goods should be presented for the control of the exit of goods from the customs territory of the Community.</p>
      <p n="29">(20) The standard rates of yield should be calculated for certain main compensating products on the basis of the corresponding coefficients set out in Annex E to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(8) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1563/2001(9) Corollary changes should be made for certain secondary compensating products.</p>
      <p n="30">(21) Annex 111 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should be amended to take account of the introduction of the single currency from 1 January 2002.</p>
      <p n="31">(22) The transitional provisions on the computerised transit system, laid down in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2787/2000(10) and in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 993/2001, should not apply to authorisations granting the status of authorised consignor or authorised consignee in connection with simplifications for certain modes of transport.</p>
      <p n="32">(23) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as well as Regulations (EC) No 2787/2000 and (EC) No 993/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="33">(24) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,</p>
      <p n="34">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="35">Article 1</p>

      <p n="47">1. Where goods declared for free circulation are part of a larger quantity of the same goods purchased in one transaction, the price actually paid or payable for the purposes of Article 29(1) of the Code shall be that price represented by the proportion of the total price which the quantity so declared bears to the total quantity purchased.</p>

      <p n="49">2.

      <p n="50">(a) the goods were defective at the moment referred to by Article 67 of the Code;</p>
      <p n="51">(b) the seller made the adjustment in performance of a warranty obligation provided for in the contract of sale, concluded before release for free circulation of the goods;</p>

      <p n="53">3. The price actually paid or payable for the goods, adjusted in accordance with paragraph 2, may be taken into account only if that adjustment was made within a period of 12 months following the date of acceptance of the declaration for entry to free circulation of the goods."</p>
