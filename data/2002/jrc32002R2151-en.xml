      <p n="2">Council Regulation (EC) No 2151/2002</p>
      <p n="3">of 28 November 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 1098/98 introducing special temporary measures for hops</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971 on the common organisation of the market in hops(1), and in particular Article 16a thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) To rectify a surplus on the market in hops, Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/98(2) introduces special temporary measures under the procedure provided for in Article 16a of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71. Thus, in the Member States deciding to apply those special measures, producer groups may, up to and including the 2002 harvest, have recourse to temporary resting and/or permanent grubbing-up of land under hops.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Although application of the special resting and grubbing-up measures over the first four years of the five-year programme adopted by the Council has permitted a reduction in land under hops of 10 % by comparison with 1997, efforts to balance the market are still required and the measures should be retained for another year.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Articles 2 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1098/98 therefore should be amended,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">Regulation (EC) No 1098/98 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="16">1. in Article 2(1):</p>
      <p n="17">- in the first subparagraph "2002 harvest" is replaced by "2003 harvest",</p>
      <p n="18">- in the second subparagraph "2003 harvest" is replaced by "2004 harvest";</p>
      <p n="19">2. the second subparagraph of Article 4 is replaced by the following:"It shall apply from the 1998 harvest up to and including the 2004 harvest."</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 28 November 2002.</p>
      <p n="24">For the Council</p>
      <p n="25">The President</p>
      <p n="26">M. Fischer Boel</p>
      <p n="27">(1) OJ L 175, 4.8.1971, p. 1. Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1514/2001 (OJ L 201, 26.7.2001, p. 8).</p>
      <p n="28">(2) OJ L 157, 25.5.1998, p. 7.</p>
