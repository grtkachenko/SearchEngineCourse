      <p n="9">(1) The Council opened, by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 2505/96(1), Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products. Community demand for the products in question should be met under the most favourable conditions. Community tariff quotas should therefore be opened at zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes from 1 July 2002, while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for these products.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended,</p>

      <p n="12">Article 1</p>
      <p n="13">The tariff quotas listed in the Annex to this Regulation shall be added to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="16">It shall take effect on 1 July 2002.</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="18">Done at Luxembourg, 8 October 2002.</p>
      <p n="19">For the Council</p>
