      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1596/2002 of 6 September 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 2760/98 concerning the implementation of a programme for cross-border cooperation in the framework of the PHARE programme</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1596/2002</p>
      <p n="3">of 6 September 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 2760/98 concerning the implementation of a programme for cross-border cooperation in the framework of the PHARE programme</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 of 18 December 1989 on economic aid to certain countries of central and eastern Europe(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001(2), and in particular Article 8 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) The PHARE 2000 review communication "Strengthening preparation for membership" announced a more programme-oriented approach through the use of "schemes" (measures) which allows PHARE cross-border cooperation to co-finance projects similar in size and nature to Interreg projects.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The Commission communication of 28 April 2000 on Interreg III guidelines(3) provides in point 11 and Annex II an indicative list of priority topics and eligible measures related to cross-border cooperation (Interreg III strand A).</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The experience gained since the entry into force of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2760/98(4), notably through setting up joint cooperation committees and implementing joint programming documents, has highlighted the need for a further alignment of the eligible actions with Interreg.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Regulation (EC) No 2760/98 should therefore be amended in order to remove the second subparagraph of Article 5(1) thereof, under which certain actions could only be financed under the terms of Article 5(2).</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Economic Restructuring in Certain Countries of Central and Eastern Europe,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">In Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2760/98 the second subparagraph is deleted.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="20">Done at Brussels, 6 September 2002.</p>
      <p n="21">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="22">GÃ¼nter Verheugen</p>
      <p n="23">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="24">(1) OJ L 375, 23.12.1989, p. 11.</p>
      <p n="25">(2) OJ L 342, 27.12.2001, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="26">(3) OJ C 143, 23.5.2000, p. 6.</p>
      <p n="27">(4) OJ L 345, 19.12.1998, p. 49.</p>
