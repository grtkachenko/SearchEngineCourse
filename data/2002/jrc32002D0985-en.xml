      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the fourth paragraph of Article 258 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular the fourth paragraph of Article 166 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the request made by the European Economic and Social Committee on 8 July 2002,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) On 8 July 2002 the European Economic and Social Committee submitted a memorandum concerning the application of Council Decision 2001/368/EC, Euratom of 7 May 2001 on the adjustment of the allowances paid to members and alternates of the Economic and Social Committee(1), in which it called for the retention of the present system.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) While accepting that reimbursements by way of daily allowances could be based on actual costs incurred rather than on a flat-rate arrangement, the Council nevertheless considers that, for practical reasons, the present system should be retained,</p>

      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">The second paragraph of Article 3 of Decision 2001/368/EC, Euratom is hereby deleted.</p>
