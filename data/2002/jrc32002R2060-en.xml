      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 20 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2019/94 of 2 August 1994 on imports of residues from the manufacture of starch from maize from the United States of America(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 396/96(4), lays down special provisions to ensure that the imported product conforms with the agreed tariff definition. These provisions include a certificate issued by the United States wet milling industry.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The agency responsible for issuing this certificate has changed. The name and address on the certificate needs to be amended accordingly. It is also appropriate to add to the certificate a reference to its date of issue.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Provision must be made for a transitional period during which certificates issued before the date of entry into force of this Regulation can be used.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Regulation (EC) No 2019/94 must therefore be amended.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2019/94, the model "Certificate of Conformity" is replaced by the model in the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">Certificates issued in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2019/94 before the date of entry into force of this Regulation shall continue to be valid.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall enter into force on the tenth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Done at Brussels, 20 November 2002.</p>
