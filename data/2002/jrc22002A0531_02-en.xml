      <p n="70">General provisions</p>
      <p n="71">1. With regard to mutual access to transport markets, the Contracting Parties agree, initially and without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article, to maintain the existing rights resulting from bilateral agreements or other bilateral arrangements concluded between each Member State of the Community and Romania.</p>
      <p n="72">However, whilst awaiting the conclusion of an agreement between the Contracting Parties on access to the road transport market, as foreseen in Article 7, Romania shall cooperate with the Member States of the Community to amend these bilateral agreements and/or arrangements as may possibly be necessary to adapt them to this Agreement.</p>
      <p n="73">2. In addition to the authorisations provided in the regimes described in paragraph 1, the Contracting Parties hereby agree to grant, for each calendar year, access to transit traffic by goods vehicles through the territories of the Member States of the Community and Romania with effect from the date on which this Agreement enters into force, by means of authorisations as follows:</p>
      <p n="74">(a) the Community will receive:</p>
      <p n="75">14000 authorisations valid in Romania;</p>

      <p n="83">(g) the adhesive stamps referred to under (c) shall be supplied by the services of the Commission to the competent authorities of Romania. These adhesive stamps shall be attached to the authorisation prior to its use so as to indicate for which Member State or Member States of the Community the authorisation is valid;</p>
