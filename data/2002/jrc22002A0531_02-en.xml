      <p n="71">1. With regard to mutual access to transport markets, the Contracting Parties agree, initially and without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article, to maintain the existing rights resulting from bilateral agreements or other bilateral arrangements concluded between each Member State of the Community and Romania.</p>
      <p n="72">However, whilst awaiting the conclusion of an agreement between the Contracting Parties on access to the road transport market, as foreseen in Article 7, Romania shall cooperate with the Member States of the Community to amend these bilateral agreements and/or arrangements as may possibly be necessary to adapt them to this Agreement.</p>
      <p n="73">2.

      <p n="83">(g) the adhesive stamps referred to under (c) shall be supplied by the services of the Commission to the competent authorities of Romania. These adhesive stamps shall be attached to the authorisation prior to its use so as to indicate for which Member State or Member States of the Community the authorisation is valid;</p>
