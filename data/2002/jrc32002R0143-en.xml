      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 143/2002</p>
      <p n="3">of 24 January 2002</p>
      <p n="4">amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 in view of the organisation of the Community surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings in 2003, 2005 and 2007</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 of 29 February 1988 on the organisation of Community surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings(1), as last amended by Commission Decision 98/377/EC(2), and in particular Article 8 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) When determining the characteristics to be surveyed, an effort should be made to limit, as far as possible, the burden on respondents to the survey.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) In order to develop and guide the common agricultural policy, the list of characteristics should be revised and adapted in view of new evolving information needs.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The new political goal to achieve a sustainable common agricultural policy calls for more information especially on the complex relations between agriculture and the environment.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The use of the collected information over a long time-span and geographical area requires that data need to be of equal quality regardless of the source.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics, set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC(3),</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 is replaced by the Annex to the present Regulation.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">Where the Commission authorises Member States to use information from sources other than statistical surveys in accordance with Article 8(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 571/88, those Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that this information is of at least equal quality to information from statistical surveys.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 3</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="21">It shall apply with respect to the Community surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings for 2003-07.</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 24 January 2002.</p>
