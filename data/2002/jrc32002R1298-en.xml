      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular Article 11(4) thereof,</p>

Such a certificate has to be issued by a competent body recognised by the Commission. Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 provides for the list of competent bodies recognised by the Commission. The authorities of Pakistan have informed the Commission that the competent body for issuing authenticity certificates for Pakistani Basmati rice is to be changed as from 1 August 2002. Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>

      <p n="16">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="17">It shall be applicable as from 1 August 2002.</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
