      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of the activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and other existing financial instruments (1) as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in particular the forth subparagraph of Article 23 (1) thereof,</p>

      <p n="9">Whereas the rules set out in this Regulation should relate to all forms of financial intervention provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (5), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (6), in Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (7), amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (8), in Regulation (EEC) No 4256/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the EAGGF Guidance Sector (9), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2085/93 (10) in Regulation (EEC) No 2080/93 of 20 July 1993 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the financial instrument of fisheries guidance (11), as well as in Regulation (EEC) No 792/93;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas this Regulation governs only some aspects of Member States' obligations pursuant to the first and second subparagraph of Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 and consequently should not impinge on any other obligations under that</p>
      <p n="11">Article;</p>

      <p n="14">Whereas the Commission should be systematically informed of judicial and administrative procedures against persons who have committed irregularities; whereas it would also be advisable to ensure the systematic transmission of information concerning the measures taken by the Member States to protect the Community's financial interests;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas it is appropriate to determine the procedures to be applied by the Member States and the Commission in cases where the sums lost through an irregularity prove to be irrecoverable;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas a minimum threshold should be set, above which cases of irregularity must automatically be reported to the Commission;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas national rules relating to criminal proceedings or mutual assistance between Member States at judicial level in criminal matters should not be affected by the provisions of this Regulation;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas it is advisable to provide for the possibility of the Community is making a contribution to legal costs and to costs arising directly out of judicial proceedings;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas, in order to prevent irregularities, cooperation between the Member States and the Commission should be reinforced, whilst every effort should be made to ensure that such action is conducted with due regard to the rules of confidentiality;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas it should be further laid down that the provisions of this Regulation shall also apply where a payment which should have been made in the context of the Structural Funds or a financial instrument having a structural objective has not been made swing to an irregularity;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas the measures laid down in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion delivered by the Management Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development and the Standing Committee on Fisheries,</p>

      <p n="65">3. In the eventuality referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission may expressly request the Member State to continue the recovery procedure.</p>

      <p n="70">Article 8</p>
      <p n="71">1.

      <p n="79">2. The information referred to in this Regulation may not, in particular, be sent to persons other than those in the Member States or within the Community institutions whose duties require that they have access to it, unless the Member State supplying it has expressly so agreed.</p>
      <p n="80">3. The names of natural or legal persons may be disclosed to another Member State or Community institution only where this is necessary in order to prevent or prosecute an irregularity or to establish whether an alleged irregularity has taken place.</p>
      <p n="81">4. Information communicated, or acquired in any form whatever pursuant to this Regulation shall be covered by professional confidentiality and be protected in the same way as similar information is protected by the national legislation of the Member State that received it and by the corresponding provisions applicable to the Community institutions.</p>
      <p n="82">In addition, that information may not be used for any purposes other than those provided for in this Regulation unless the authorities that have provided it have given their express consent, and provided that the provisions in force in the Member State in which the recipient authority is to be found do not prohibit such communication or use.</p>
      <p n="83">5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not impede the use, in any legal actions or proceedings subsequently instituted for non-compliance with Community rules in the area of Structural Funds and financial instruments with strucutral objectives, of information obtained pursuant to this Regulation. The competent authority of the Member State which supplied this information shall be informed forthwith of such use.</p>
      <p n="84">6.

Such person shall thereupon cease to be treated, by virtue of the earlier notification, as a person involved in the irregularity in question.</p>
      <p n="85">Article 11</p>
      <p n="86">In cases of cofinancing borne jointly by a Structural Fund or financial instrument with structural objectives and by a Member State, the amounts recovered shall be shared by that Member State and the Community in proportion to the expenditure already incurred by them.</p>
      <p n="87">Article 12</p>
      <p n="88">1. Where the irregularities relate to sums of less than ECU 4 000 charged to the Community budget, Member States shall not forward to the Commission the information provided for in Articles 3 and 5, unless the latter expressly requests it.</p>
      <p n="89">2. The amount referred to in paragraph 1 shall be converted into national currency by applying the exchange rates published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, C series, which are valid on the first working day of the year in which the information on the irregularities is communicated.</p>
      <p n="90">Article 13</p>
      <p n="91">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="92">The period between the day of entry into force and the end of the current quarter shall be deemed to be a quarter for the purposes of Articles 3 and 5.</p>
