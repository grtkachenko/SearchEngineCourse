      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 of 29 March 1994 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 774/94 of 29 March 1994 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas the Community negotiated new tariff concessions under Article XXVIII of the GATT; whereas these negotiations led to agreements with Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Poland, Sweden and Uruguay; whereas these agreements were approved by Council Decision of 20 December 1993 (1);</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the agreements in question provide for the opening on 1 January 1994, under certain conditions, of annual tariff quotas for high-quality beef falling within CN codes 0201 30 00, 0202 30 90, 0206 10 95 and 0206 29 91, pigmeat falling within CN codes 0203 19 13 and 0203 29 15, poultrymeat falling within CN codes 0207 41 10, 0207 41 41, 0207 41 71, 0207 42 10, 0207 42 11 and 0207 42 71, wheat and meslin falling within CN codes 1001 10 00 and 1001 90 99, and brans, sharps and other residues falling within CN codes 2302 30 10, 2302 30 90, 2303 40 10 and 2303 40 20; whereas these quotas have therefore to be opened with effect from 1 January 1994;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the agreements in question cover an undetermined period; whereas in the interests of rationalization and efficiency, the quotas should therefore be opened on a multiannual basis;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas a system guaranteeing the nature, provenance and origin of the products may prove to be appropriate; whereas to that end imports within the framework of these new tariff concessions should be subject, where appropriate, to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas it may be appropriate to spread out these imports over the year on the basis of the needs of the Community market; whereas to that end a system for using up quotas based on the presentation of an import licence may prove appropriate;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the Council's approval of the abovementioned agreements renders redundant the system provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1058/88 of 28 March 1988 on the import of bran, sharps and other residues derived from sifting, milling or other working of cereals other than maize and rice and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (2); whereas that Regulation should consequently be repealed;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas detailed rules for the application of this Regulation and, in particular, the provisions required for the sound administration of the quotas must be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (3) or in the corresponding Articles of the other Regulations on the common organization of the markets affected by the opening of the quotas;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 234/79 of 5 February 1979 on the procedure for adjusting the Common Customs Tariff nomenclature used for agricultural products (4) and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (5) already provide that the Commission may make the technical amendments and adjustments to this Regulation as are necessary following the amendments to the combined nomenclature and to the Taric codes; whereas any adjustments to the quota volumes and other quota requirements adopted by the Council will also require that amendments be made to this regulation; whereas, for the purpose of simplifying matters, provision should be made for the Commission to make such amendments and adjustments to this regulation in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 or in the other abovementioned Regulations,</p>
