That adjustment shall involve as appropriate, the exclusion or inclusion, in the total exported quantities used for calculating that coefficient, of the quantities exported to those markets for which the refund is abolished or reintroduced. The adjusted coefficient shall apply from the first day of the fiscal distillation period following the change in the eligibility of the markets concerned.'</p>
      <p n="13">2. The following paragraph 4 is added to Article 12:</p>
      <p n="14">'4. Where the coefficient is adjusted pursuant to Article 7 (2), refunds incorrectly paid from the date of application of the adjusted coefficient shall be repaid by the beneficiaries.'</p>
