      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 120/94 of 25 January 1994 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1533/93 laying down certain detailed rules under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals, and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common oranization of the market in cereals (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2193/93 (2), and in particular Article 13 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, in order not to hinder the majority of Community exports by requesting proof of arrival at destination, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1533/93 (3) provides that submission of such proof is not required for payment of refunds fixed by invitation to tender whenever exportation takes place by sea; whereas those same provisions are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 (4);</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas in the cereals sector the only refund rate lower than that applicable to exports to all third countries is that applicable to exports to Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein; whereas, as a result, provision should be made to ensure that products for which an 'all third countries' refund rate has been granted are not exported to the aforementioned countries; whereas, consequently, the refund fixed by invitation to tender should be adjusted for exports intended for those countries;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, in order to ensure that exports are made by sea, Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1533/93 and Article 17 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 provide that the minimum size of vessels suitable for sea transport is to be 2 500 tonnes GRT; whereas it has been established that the concept of 'GRT' is not the most appropriate for the purposes of the aforementioned objectives; whereas, for those purposes, it is preferable to take the quantities actually loaded as the reference; whereas, as a result, Regulations (EEC) No 1533/93 and (EEC) No 2131/93 should be amended;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="15">2. The following Article 14a is inserted:</p>
      <p n="16">'Article 14a</p>
      <p n="17">Where the operator provides proof of completion of customs formalities for release for consumption in Switzerland, Austria or Liechtenstein, the amount of the "all third countries" export refund fixed by invitation to tender shall be reduced by the difference between that amount and the amount of the export refund in force for the aforementioned destinations on the day of the award of the contract.'</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">The second indent of Article 17 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 is hereby replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="20">'- the proof referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 3665/87 has been provided.
