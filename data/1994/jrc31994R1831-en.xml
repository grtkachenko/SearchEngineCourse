This information must be sufficiently detailed to allow the Commission to decide as soon as possible after consulting the authorities of the Member States concerned, who shall bear the financial consequences within the meaning of the third indent of Article 12 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 1164/94.</p>
      <p n="61">3. In the eventuality referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission may expressly request the beneficiary Member State to continue the recovery procedure.</p>

      <p n="67">1.

      <p n="68">2. Independently of the contracts referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall inform the Member States where the nature of the irregularity is such as to suggest that identical or similar practices could occur in other Member States.</p>
      <p n="69">3. The Commission shall organize information meetings at Community level for representatives of the Member States in order to examine with them the information obtained pursuant to Articles 3, 4 and 5 and pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, in particular with regard to the lessons to be learned therefrom in connection with irregularities, preventive measures and legal proceedings.</p>

      <p n="72">The Commission shall regularly inform the Member States, in the framework of the Consultative Committee for Coordination in the field of fraud prevention, of the order of magnitude of the funds involved in the irregularities which have been discovered and of the various categories of irregularity, broken down by type and counted up.</p>

      <p n="76">3. The names of natural or legal persons may be disclosed to another Member State or Community institution only where this is necessary in order to prevent or prosecute an irregularity or to establish whether an alleged irregularity has taken place.</p>
      <p n="77">4. Information communicated, or acquired in any form whatever pursuant to this Regulation shall be covered by professional confidentiality and be protected in the same way as similar information is protected by the national legislation of the Member State that received it and by the corresponding provisions applicable to the Community institutions.</p>
      <p n="78">In addition, that information may not be used for any purposes other than those provided for in this Regulation unless the authorities that have provided it have given their express consent, and provided that the provisions in force in the Member State in which the recipient authority is to be found do not prohibit such communication or use.</p>
      <p n="79">5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not impede the use, in any legal actions or proceedings subsequently instituted for non-compliance with Community rules in the area of Cohesion Fund, of information obtained pursuant to this Regulation. The competent authority of the Member State which supplied this information shall be informed forthwith of such use.</p>
      <p n="80">6. Where a Member State notified the Commission that a natural or legal person whose name has been communicated to the Commission pursuant to this Regulation proves on further inquiry not to be involved in any irregularity, the Commission shall forthwith inform all those to whom it disclosed that name pursuant to this Regulation of that fact. Such person shall thereupon cease to be treated, by virtue of the earlier notification, as a person involved in the irregularity in question.</p>
      <p n="81">Article 11</p>
      <p n="82">In cases of co-finacing borne jointly by the Cohesion Fund and by a beneficiary Member State, the amounts recovered shall be shared by that Member State and the Community in proportion to the expenditure already incurred by them.</p>
      <p n="83">Article 12</p>
      <p n="84">1. Where the irregularities relate to sums of less than ECU 4 000 charged to the Community budget, beneficiary Member States shall not forward to the Commission the information provided for in Articles 3 and 5 unless the latter explicity requests it.</p>
      <p n="85">2. The amount referred to in paragraph 1 shall be converted into national currency by applying the exchange rates published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, C Series, which are valid on the first working day of the year in which the information on the irregularities is communicated.</p>
      <p n="86">Article 13</p>
      <p n="87">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="88">The period between the day of entry into force and the end of the current calendar quarter shall be deemed to be a quarter for the purposes of Articles 3 and 5.</p>
      <p n="89">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
