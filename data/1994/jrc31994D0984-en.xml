      <p n="4">laying down animal health conditons and veterinary certificates for the importation of fresh poultrymeat from certain third countries</p>

      <p n="6">(94/984/EC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 91/494/EEC of 26 June 1991 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and imports from third countries of fresh poultrymeat (1), as last amended by Directive 93/121/EC (2), and in particular Articles 11 and 12 thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Commission Decision 94/85/EC (3), as last amended by Decision 94/453/EC (4), established a list of third countries from where importation of fresh poultrymeat is authorized;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas Commission Decision 94/438/EC (5) has laid down the general requirements for the classification of third countries with regard to avian influenza and Newcastle disease in relation to imports of fresh poultrymeat;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas it is appropriate to restrict the scope of this Decision to poultry species covered by Council Directive 71/118/EEC (6), as last amended and updated by Directive 92/116/EEC (7) and to lay down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification for other poultry species in a separate Decision;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas therefore the animal health conditions and the veterinary certificates have to be laid down; whereas, since there are different groups of similar health situations between two or more third countries, it is appropriate to establish different health certificates in the light of those situations;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas it is now possible, in accordance with information received from the third countries concerned and with the results of inspections carried out by the Commission services in some of these countries, to lay down two categories of certification;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the situation of the other third countries for which it is not yet possible to lay down a certificate is being studied attentively in order to see if they comply with the Community criteria or not; whereas this Decision shall be reviewed at the latest on 31 October 1995 to authorize or prohibit imports from those countries;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas this Decision applies without prejudice to measures taken for poultrymeat imported for other purposes than human consumption;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas, since a new certification scheme is being established, a period of time should be provided for its implementation;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
      <p n="19">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="20">Article 1</p>
      <p n="21">Member States shall authorize the importation of fresh poultrymeat from third countries or from parts of third countries listed in Annex I, provided that it meets the requirements of the corresponding animal health certificate set out in Annex II and that it is accompanied by such a certificate, duly completed and signed. The certificate shall include the general part conforming to Annex II, Part 1, and one of the specific health certificates conforming to Annex II, Part 2, in accordance with the model referred to in Annex I.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 2</p>
      <p n="23">This Decision shall apply from 1 May 1995.</p>
      <p n="24">Article 3</p>
      <p n="25">This Decision shall be reviewed no later than 31 October 1995.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 4</p>
      <p n="27">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
