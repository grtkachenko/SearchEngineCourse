      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2515/94 of 9 September 1994 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1848/93 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 on certificates of specific character for agricultural products and foodstuffs</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>

      <p n="6">Whereas, for the purpose of promoting and enhancing the specific character of their products and of informing the consumer, the trade circles concerned should have the Community symbol and the indication referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 made available to them; whereas it is therefore necessary, for the purpose of the correct use of the symbol and the indication, that the technical rules for their reproduction be drawn up;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, in order to avoid confusion on the part of the consumer in the face of the abundance of information in the agri-foodstuffs sector, information should as far as possible be homogenous when a producer and/or processor wishes to avail himself of the advantage offered by the system of certificates of specific character established by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92; whereas, consequently, the producer and/or processor should use the models provided for in this Regulation;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, in consideration of each market's requirements, the choice of the appropriate language model for the placing on the market of the agricultural product of foodstuff should be left to the producer and/or processor;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, with a view to increasing the credibility of the mark attributed to the specific agricultural products or foodstuffs, the name of the inspection authority or body should be indicated on the label intended for the placing on the market of the product;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, for the purpose of the inspection arrangements, it is necessary that Member States have lists of producers authorized to use the registered name together with the Community symbol and the indication;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas these requirements mean that Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1848/93 ((2)) should be amended;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Certificates of Specific Character,</p>
