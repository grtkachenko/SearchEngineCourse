      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1586/94 of 30 June 1994 amending Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 concerning production refunds in the cereals and rice sectors respectively</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 21 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2193/93 (2), and in particular Article 7 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 of 21 June 1976 on the common organization of the market in rice (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1544/93 (4), and in particular Article 9 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Article 5 (1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulations (EEC) No 1766/92 and (EEC) No 1418/76 concerning production refunds in the cereals and rice sectors respectively (5) specifies that applications for refund certificates are to be addressed in writing to the competent authority; whereas it is appropriate that the days on which such applications may be made should be specified and that a time limit be set for the submission of applications;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, under the second subparagraph of Article 6 (3), during July and August of the 1993/94, 1994/95 and 1995/96 marketing years, certificates are valid only until the last day of the month during which the certificate was issued; whereas this short period of validity may result in numerous applications for certificates; whereas it is appropriate, therefore, to specify 31 August as the final day of validity for all certificates issued in July and August;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas application of the rate of refund valid on the day of processing in the case of applications for certificates lodged in July of the 1994/95 and 1995/96 marketing years permits closer monitoring of the variation in the refund rate during the period of validity of the certification;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,</p>
      <p n="11">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="12">Article 1</p>

      <p n="14">1. The following is added to Article 5 (1):</p>
      <p n="15">'The application shall be lodged each working day before 5 p.m., Brussels time'.</p>
      <p n="16">2. The second subparagraph of Article 6 (3) is replaced by:</p>
      <p n="17">'However, during July and August of the 1994/95 and 1995/96 marketing years, certificates applied for during the months in question shall be valid only until 31 August'.</p>
      <p n="18">3. The following is added to the first subparagraph of Article 6 (4):</p>
      <p n="19">'However, in the case of a refund application lodged during July of the 1994/95 and 1995/96 marketing years, the amount of the refund payable shall be the amount applicable on the day of processing of the starch'.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 1994.</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 30 June 1994.</p>
