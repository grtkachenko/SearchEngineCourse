      <head n="1">Council Directive 94/33/EC of 22 June 1994 on the protection of young people at work</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 94/33/EC of 22 June 1994 on the protection of young people at work</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 118a thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Article 118a of the Treaty provides that the Council shall adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements to encourage improvements, especially in the working environment, as regards the health and safety of workers;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, under that Article, such directives must avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas points 20 and 22 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, adopted by the European Council in Strasbourg on 9 December 1989, state that:</p>
      <p n="11">'20. Without prejudice to such rules as may be more favourable to young people, in particular those ensuring their preparation for work through vocational training, and subject to derogations limited to certain light work, the minimum employment age must not be lower than the minimum school-leaving age and, in any case, not lower than 15 years;</p>
      <p n="12">22. Appropriate measures must be taken to adjust labour regulations applicable to young workers so that their specific development and vocational training and access to employment needs are met.</p>
      <p n="13">The duration of work must, in particular, be limited - without it being possible to circumvent this limitation through recourse to overtime - and night work prohibited in the case of workers of under eighteen years of age, save in the case of certain jobs laid down in national legislation or regulations.';</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas account should be taken of the principles of the International Labour Organization regarding the protection of young people at work, including those relating to the minimum age for access to employment or work;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas, in this Resolution on child labour (4), the European Parliament summarized the various aspects of work by young people and stressed its effects on their health, safety and physical and intellectual development, and pointed to the need to adopt a Directive harmonizing national legislation in the field;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas Article 15 of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (5) provides that particularly sensitive risk groups must be protected against the dangers which specifically affect them;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas children and adolescents must be considered specific risk groups, and measures must be taken with regard to their safety and health;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas the vulnerability of children calls for Member States to prohibit their employment and ensure that the minimum working or employment age is not lower than the minimum age at which compulsory schooling as imposed by national law ends or 15 years in any event; whereas derogations from the prohibition on child labour may be admitted only in special cases and under the conditions stipulated in this Directive; whereas, under no circumstances, may such derogations be detrimental to regular school attendance or prevent children benefiting fully from their education;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas, in view of the nature of the transition from childhood to adult life, work by adolescents should be strictly regulated and protected;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas every employer should guarantee young people working conditions appropriate to their age;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas employers should implement the measures necessary to protect the safety and health of young people on the basis on an assessment of work-related hazards to the young;</p>
      <p n="22">Whereas Member States should protect young people against any specific risks arising from their lack of experience, absence of awareness of existing or potential risks, or from their immaturity;</p>
      <p n="23">Whereas Member States should therefore prohibit the employment of young people for the work specified by this Directive;</p>
      <p n="24">Whereas the adoption of specific minimal requirements in respect of the organization of working time is likely to improve working conditions for young people;</p>
      <p n="25">Whereas the maximum working time of young people should be strictly limited and night work by young people should be prohibited, with the exception of certain jobs specified by national legislation or rules;</p>
      <p n="26">Whereas Member States should take the appropriate measures to ensure that the working time of adolescents receiving school education does not adversely affect their ability to benefit from that education;</p>
      <p n="27">Whereas time spent on training by young persons working under a theoretical and/or practical combined work/training scheme or an in-plant work-experience should be counted as working time;</p>
      <p n="28">Whereas, in order to ensure the safety and health of young people, the latter should be granted minimum daily, weekly and annual periods of rest and adequate breaks;</p>
      <p n="29">Whereas, with respect to the weekly rest period, due account should be taken of the diversity of cultural, ethnic, religious and other factors prevailing in the Member States; whereas in particular, it is ultimately for each Member State to decide whether Sunday should be included in the weekly rest period, and if so to what extent;</p>
      <p n="30">Whereas appropriate work experience may contribute to the aim of preparing young people for adult working and social life, provided it is ensured that any harm to their safety, health and development is avoided;</p>
      <p n="31">Whereas, although derogations from the bans and limitations imposed by this Directive would appear indispensable for certain activities or particular situations, applications thereof must not prejudice the principles underlying the established protection system;</p>
      <p n="32">Whereas this Directive constitutes a tangible step towards developing the social dimension of the internal market;</p>
      <p n="33">Whereas the application in practice of the system of protection laid down by this Directive will require that Member States implement a system of effective and proportionate measures;</p>
      <p n="34">Whereas the implementation of some provisions of this Directive poses particular problems for one Member State with regard to its system of protection for young people at work; whereas that Member State should therefore be allowed to refrain from implementing the relevant provisions for a suitable period,</p>
      <p n="35">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="36">SECTION I</p>
      <p n="37">Article 1</p>

      <p n="58">(ii) is not such as to be harmful to their attendance at school, their participation in vocational guidance or training programmes approved by the competent authority or their capacity to benefit from the instruction received;</p>

      <p n="63">1. Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to prohibit work by children.</p>
      <p n="64">2. Taking into account the objectives set out in Article 1, Member States may make legislative or regulatory provision for the prohibition of work by children not to apply to:</p>

      <p n="68">3. Member States that make use of the opinion referred to in paragraph 2 (c) shall determine, subject to the provisions of this Directive, the working conditions relating to the light work in question.</p>

      <p n="73">(i) are not likely to be harmful to the safety, health or development of children, and</p>

      <p n="77">SECTION II</p>
      <p n="78">Article 6</p>
      <p n="79">General obligations on employers</p>
      <p n="80">1. Without prejudice to Article 4 (1), the employer shall adopt the measures necessary to protect the safety and health of young people, taking particular account of the specific risks referred to in Article 7 (1).</p>
      <p n="81">2. The employer shall implement the measures provided for in paragraph 1 on the basis of an assessment of the hazards to young people in connection with their work.</p>
      <p n="82">The assessment must be made before young people begin work and when there is any major change in working conditions and must pay particular attention to the following points:</p>
      <p n="83">(a) the fitting-out and layout of the workplace and the workstation;</p>
      <p n="84">(b) the nature, degree and duration of exposure to physical, biological and chemical agents;</p>
      <p n="85">(c) the form, range and use of work equipment, in particular agents, machines, apparatus and devices, and the way in which they are handled;</p>
      <p n="86">(d) the arrangement of work processes and operations and the way in which these are combined (organization of work);</p>
      <p n="87">(e) the level of training and instruction given to young people.</p>
      <p n="88">Where this assessment shows that there is a risk to the safety, the physical or mental health or development of young people, an appropriate free assessment and monitoring of their health shall be provided at regular intervals without prejudice to Directive 89/391/EEC.</p>
      <p n="89">The free health assessment and monitoring may form part of a national health system.</p>
      <p n="90">3. The employer shall inform young people of possible risks and of all measures adopted concerning their safety and health.</p>
      <p n="91">Furthermore, he shall inform the legal representatives of children of possible risks and of all measures adopted concerning children's safety and health.</p>

      <p n="94">Vulnerability of young people - Prohibition of work</p>
      <p n="95">1. Member States shall ensure that young people are protected from any specific risks to their safety, health and development which are a consequence of their lack of experience, of absence of awareness of existing or potential risks or of the fact that young people have not yet fully matured.</p>
      <p n="96">2. Without prejudice to Article 4 (1), Member States shall to this end prohibit the employment of young people for:</p>
      <p n="97">(a) work which is objectively beyond their phyiscal or psychological capacity;</p>

      <p n="102">Work which is likely to entail specific risks for young people within the meaning of paragraph 1 includes:</p>
      <p n="103">- work involving harmful exposure to the physical, biological and chemical agents referred to in point I of the Annex, and</p>
      <p n="104">- processes and work referred to in point II of the Annex.</p>
      <p n="105">3. Member States may, by legislative or regulatory provision, authorize derogations from paragraph 2 in the case of adolescents where such derogations are indispensable for their vocational training, provided that protection of their safety and health is ensured by the fact that the work is performed under the supervision of a competent person within the meaning of Article 7 of Directive 89/391/EEC and provided that the protection afforded by that Directive is guaranteed.</p>
      <p n="106">SECTION III</p>
      <p n="107">Article 8</p>
      <p n="108">Working time</p>
      <p n="109">1. Member States which make use of the option in Article 4 (2) (b) or (c) shall adopt the measures necessary to limit the working time of children to:</p>

      <p n="115">2. Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to limit the working time of adolescents to eight hours a day and 40 hours a week.</p>

      <p n="117">4. Where a young person is employed by more than one employer, working days and working time shall be cumulative.</p>
      <p n="118">5. Member States may, by legislative or regulatory provision, authorize derogations from paragraph 1 (a) and paragraph 2 either by way of exception or where there are objective grounds for so doing.</p>
      <p n="119">Member States shall, by legislative or regulatory provision, determine the conditions, limits and procedure for implementing such derogations.</p>
      <p n="120">Article 9</p>

      <p n="125">In that event, Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the adolescent is supervised by an adult where such supervision is necessary for the adolescent's protection.</p>
      <p n="126">(b) If point (a) is applied, work shall continue to be prohibited between midnight and 4 a.m.</p>
      <p n="127">However, Member States may, by legislative or regulatory provision, authorize work by adolescents during the period in which night work is prohibited in the following cases, where there are objective grounds for so doing and provided that adolescents are allowed suitable compensatory rest time and that the objectives set out in Article 1 are not called into question:</p>

      <p n="129">- work performed in the context of the armed forces or the police;</p>
      <p n="130">- work performed in hospitals or similar establishments;</p>

      <p n="132">3. Prior to any assignment to night work and at regular intervals thereafter, adolescents shall be entitled to a free assessment of their health and capacities, unless the work they do during the period during which work is prohibited is of an exceptional nature.</p>
