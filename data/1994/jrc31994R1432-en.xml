      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1432/94 of 22 June 1994 laying down detailed rules for the application in the pigmeat sector of the import arrangements provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for pigmeat and certain other agricultural products</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 of 29 March 1994 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues (1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1249/89 (3), and in particular Article 22 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 opened, from 1 January 1994, new annual tariff quotas for certain pigmeat products; whereas the said quotas are to apply for an unspecified period;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, the administration of the arrangements should be based on import licences; whereas, to that end, the detailed rules for submission of the applications and the information which must appear on the applications and licences, by way of derogation from Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3519/93 (5), should be laid down; whereas, in addition, provision should be made for the licences to be issued after a period of consideration, applying, where necessary, a single percentage of acceptance; whereas, it is appropriate, in the interest of the operators, to provide for the possibility to withdraw the application for certificates after the fixing of a coefficient of acceptance;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Regulation (EC) No 774/94 provides for the levy to be fixed at 0 % for imports of certain pigmeat products, up to a certain quantity; whereas, in order to ensure the regularity of imports, the quantity in question should be staggered over one year;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, in order to ensure proper administration of the system, the security for import licences under the said system should be fixed at ECU 30 per 100 kilograms; whereas, in view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the pigmeat sector, precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>

      <p n="15">Article 2</p>
      <p n="16">The quantity fixed in Annex I shall be staggered over the year as folllows:</p>
      <p n="17">- 25 % in the period 1 January to 31 March,</p>
      <p n="18">- 25 % in the period 1 April to 30 June,</p>
      <p n="19">- 25 % in the period 1 July to 30 September,</p>
      <p n="20">- 25 % in the period 1 October to 31 December.</p>
      <p n="21">However, for the period from 1 January to 30 September 1994, the quantity fixed in Annex I shall amount to 5 250 tonnes.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 3</p>
      <p n="23">The import licences referred to in Article 1 shall be subject to the following provisions:</p>
      <p n="24">(a) Applicants for import licences must be natural or legal persons who, at the time applications are submitted, can prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities in the Member States that they have been active in trade with third countries in products in the pigmeat sector for at least the preceding 12 months.

      <p n="54">4. The Commission shall decide as quickly as possible to what extent quantities may be awarded in respect of applications as referred to in Article 3.</p>
