      <head n="1">Commission Directive 94/38/EC of 26 July 1994 amending Annexes C and D to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 94/38/EC of 26 July 1994 amending Annexes C and D to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 92/51/EEC of 18 June 1992 on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC (1), and in particular Article 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, when examining a reasoned request for adding an education or training course to the list in Annex C or D or for removing such a course from one of those Annexes, the Commission, pursuant to Article 15 (2) of Directive 92/51/EEC, is required to verify in particular whether the qualification resulting from the course in question confers on the holder a level of professional education or training of a comparably high level to that of the post-secondary course referred to in point (i) of the second indent of the first subparagraph of Article 1 (a), and a similar level of responsibility and activity;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the German Government has made reasoned requests for the amendment of Annexes C and D to the Directive and the Italian Government has made a reasoned request for the amendment of Annex C;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, in particular, the reference to the professional title of physiotherapist ('Krankengymnast(in)') in Germany needs to be amended following a change in national legislation which has introduced ane professional title without, however, altering the structure of the professional education and training;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in particular, the training courses to be added to the list in Annex C in respect of Germany have the same structure as those already listed, in respect of Germany, Italy and Luxembourg, at point 1 ('Paramedical and childcare training courses') in that Annex;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Italy has altered its education and training courses for accountants ('regioniere') and accountancy experts ('perito commerciale'), with the result that those courses now come under Council Directive 89/48/EEC (2); whereas, in the case of work consultants ('consulenti del lavoro'), the course of education and training covered by Directive 89/48/EEC is now the principal form of education and training for the profession concerned; whereas, accordingly, education and training courses for those two professions should no longer be included in Annex C, since holders of qualifications covered by Directive 92/51/EEC could, by virtue of Article 1 (a) of Directive 89/48/EEC, apply to be treated in the same way;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas in accordance with Article 2 of Directive 92/51/EEC the provisions of that Directive are not applicable to activities covered by any of the Directives listed in Annex A thereto, including the Directives made applicable to the pursuit as an employed person of the activities listed in Annex B, even if a national of a Member State has completed one of the 'courses having a special structure' referred to in Annex D;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, in particular, the training courses to be added to the list in Annex D in respect of Germany are similar in structure to certain training courses in Annex C and invariably feature a total duration of 13 years or more, including three years or more of vocational training;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, in accordance with Article 17 (2) of Directive 92/51/EEC and in order to increase the effectiveness of the general system, those Member States whose education and training courses are listed in Annex D should send a list of the diplomas concerned to the Commission;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, in order to make Annexes C and D easier to read, the lists as amended should be published;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion given by the Committee established by Article 15 of Directive 92/51/EEC,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">Annexes C and D to Directive 92/51/EEC are hereby amended as shown in Annex I hereto.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">The amended lists of the courses of education and training which appear in Annexes C and D to Directive 92/51/EEC are shown in Annex II to this Directive.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 3</p>
      <p n="22">1. Member States shall adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary for them to comply with this Directive before 1 October 1994. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="23">When Member States adopt these provisions, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The procedure for such reference shall be adopted by Member States.</p>
      <p n="24">2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 4</p>
      <p n="26">This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="27">Done at Brussels, 26 July 1994.</p>
