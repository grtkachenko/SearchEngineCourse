      <p n="46">provided that the claim includes no amount, by way of interest, charge or otherwise, to compensate for the fact that performance was, as a result of those measures, not made in accordance with the terms of the relevant contract or transaction.</p>
      <p n="47">Article 4</p>
      <p n="48">In any proceedings for the enforcement of a claim, the onus of proving that satisfying the claim is not prohibited by Article 2 shall be on the person seeking the enforcement of that claim.</p>
