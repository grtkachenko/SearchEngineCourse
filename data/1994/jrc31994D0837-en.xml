      <p n="10">Whereas rules for the health marking of the products from these rewrapping centres should also be laid down;</p>

Rewrapping centres carrying out unwrapping and rewrapping operations, must fulfil the relevant conditions set out in Annex A, Chapters I and II to Directive 77/99/EEC and the pertinent conditions set out in Annex B, Chapter I, points 1 (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) and 2 (a), (c), (i) and (j) to the said Directive.</p>
