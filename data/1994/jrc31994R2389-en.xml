      <p n="9">Whereas, on the basis of the experience gained, the period in which licence certificates are to be lodged must be brought forward by one month so that quotas can be used from the start of each period rather than from the end of first month of each period, as is currently the case;</p>

      <p n="20">3. Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1431/94 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 October 1994.</p>
      <p n="23">However, Article 1 (2) shall apply from 1 March 1995.</p>
