      <p n="10">Whereas the derogations referred to in Article 9 (1) and (2) of Directive 77/99/EEC concern only the structure of the estabishments and not the hygienic requirements laid down in the said Directive;</p>

      <p n="15">When fixing that limit, they shall take particular account of the following parameters: the establishment's structure and layout, the flow of the products, and the storage capacity for raw materials and end products.</p>
      <p n="16">2. The granting of the derogations referred to in paragraph 1 is subject to observance by each establishment of the production limit laid down in pursuance of paragraph 1.</p>
      <p n="17">3. In no case shall the production limit laid down in paragraph 1 exceed a quantity of 7,5 tonnes of finished product per week, or one tonne per week in the case of foie gras production.</p>
