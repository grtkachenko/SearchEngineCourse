      <head n="1">Regulation (EEC) No 1728/74 of the Council of 27 June 1974 on the coordination of agricultural research</head>
      <p n="2">REGULATION (EEC) No 1728/74 OF THE COUNCIL of 27 June 1974 on the coordination of agricultural research</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and in particular Article 43 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas effective coordination of research in agriculture should have as its aim the best possible organization, in the general interest, of the efforts made in the Member States, effective use of the results of these efforts, orientation of them in such a way that they are consistent with the needs of the common agricultural policy, and the pooling of research facilities with a view to studying certain problems of particular importance to the Community;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas in order to achieve this aim, it is necessary to make provision for exchanges of information and reciprocal consultation on the programmes of agricultural research already existing or envisaged in the Member States;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas in a certain number of cases the desired objective may be attained through coordination at Community level of certain national research projects;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, however, these measures may appear insufficient either because of their nature, or because the means available to the Member States do not allow them to increase their research efforts in such a way as to fulfil the requirements of the common agricultural policy entirely ; whereas in these cases, the Community should be able to support and supplement the efforts made in the Member States in order to meet research requirements more effectively and to fulfil the needs of the common agricultural policy;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas since the coordination of agricultural research is closely linked to the common agricultural policy, and since, as a result, efforts are concentrated especially on coordinating applied research, the earliest possible utilization by farmers of the results of this research must be ensured;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, because of the needs of coordination and as a result of the complexity of the scientific problems to be studied and the projects to be implemented, direct and continuous cooperation between the Commission and the Member States is desirable;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas within the framework of the general policy in the field of science and technology worked out by the Commission with the help of the relevant consultative bodies, the most appropriate way of developing cooperation is to set up a Committee consisting of representatives of the Member States and presided over by a representative of the Commission which could usefully help and advise the Commission in carrying out the tasks which devolve upon it in the field of the coordination of research in agriculture;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the coordination of national efforts demands a thorough knowledge of the situation in each Member State so far as agricultural research is concerned as well as sufficient information on other research relevant to agriculture ; whereas it is necessary to determine the procedure whereby the data so obtained will be made available to the users;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas care must be taken to put the results of research in which the Community takes part at the disposal of the Community;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas in order to ensure practical application of the results obtained, it is necessary to promote the publication and dissemination of the results,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
      <p n="19">1. In order to further the attainment of the aims of the common agricultural policy, coordination and promotion at Community level of agricultural research activities undertaken in the Member States shall take place in accordance with the provisions laid down in this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="20">2. In applying this Regulation account shall be taken, in a suitable manner, of the general scientific and technological policy laid down by the Community's institutions.</p>
      <p n="21">TITLE I Information and consultation</p>
      <p n="22">Article 2</p>

      <p n="25">1. The Member States shall provide the Commission with scientific, economic and financial information concerning agricultural research activities either planned or being carried out under their authority.</p>
      <p n="26">They shall endeavour to provide the Commission with the same information concerning agricultural research activities planned or being carried out by bodies which do not come under their authority.</p>
      <p n="27">2. The Commission shall keep a permanent inventory of the activities referred to in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p n="28">3.
