      <p n="5">Whereas the volume of research involving small quantities of special fissile materials has increased both within the Community and in countries outside the Community since Regulation No 17/66/Euratom entered into force on 29 November 1966;</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas the Community is able, without prejudice to the supply position of consumers within the Community, to contribute to the development of research in many different fields through the supply of special fissile materials produced in its Member States;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, therefore, the supply position permits the extension of the rule on exemption in Article 74 to cover special fissile materials produced within the Community,</p>

In the case of imports and exports this shall apply subject to the provisions of agreements for cooperation concluded by the Community with third countries."</p>
