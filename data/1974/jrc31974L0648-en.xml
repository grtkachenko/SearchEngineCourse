      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 9 December 1974 amending Directive No 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine (74/648/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof;</p>

      <p n="7">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, for the reasons given below, amendments should be made to certain provisions of Council Directive No 68/193/EEC (3) of 9 April 1968 on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine, as amended by Directive No 71/140/EEC (4);</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the scope of Directive No 68/193/EEC should be made clear;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Member States must be authorized to distinguish between standard propagation material on the basis of different quality criteria;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas certain regions benefit from particular conditions which are so favourable for the development of propagation material that the Member State concerned should be enabled to authorize exemptions as to the length of the propagation material for production and marketing in their territories;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the application of the Directive may cause difficulties for importation into certain Member States, since some of them require importers to supply different particulars ; whereas these particulars should therefore be harmonized;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the amendments to the Annex are intended essentially to permit the application of the Directive and, on these grounds, should be adopted in accordance with the procedure of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the growing of vines and the marketing of propagation material may be of minimal economic importance in a Member State ; whereas the Member State concerned should therefore have the possibility of being exempted from most of the provisions of the Directive,</p>
