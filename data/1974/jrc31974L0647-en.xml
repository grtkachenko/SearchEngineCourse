      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 9 December 1974 on control of carnation leaf-rollers (74/647/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the production of carnations occupies an important place in Community agriculture;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the carnation yield is constantly threatened by harmful organisms;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, through the protection of carnation cultivation against such harmful organisms, not only should productive capacity be maintained but also agricultural productivity increased;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas protective measures to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms into individual Member States would have only a limited effect if such organisms were not controlled simultaneously and methodically throughout the Community and were not prevented from spreading;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the organisms most harmful to carnations are the Mediterranean and South African leaf-rollers;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas these harmful organisms have occurred in several Member States;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas there is a permanent risk to carnation cultivation throughout the Community if effective measures are not taken to control these harmful organisms and to prevent them from spreading;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas, in order to eradicate these harmful organisms, minimum provisions must be adopted for the Community ; whereas Member States must be able to adopt additional or stricter provisions where necessary,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">This Directive concerns the minimum measures to be taken within Member States to control carnation leaf-rollers and to prevent them from spreading.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">For the purposes of this Directive "carnation leaf-roller" means the Mediterranean carnation leaf-roller (Cacoecimorpha pronubana Hb) and the South African carnation leaf-roller (Epichoristodes acerbella (Walk.) Diak.).</p>
      <p n="21">Article 3</p>
      <p n="22">1. Member States shall provide that carnations (Dianthus L.) be put into circulation only if they are not contaminated by carnation leaf-rollers and that carnation cultures contaminated by carnation leaf-rollers must be treated in such a way that the carnations obtained from them are no longer contaminated at the time when they are put into circulation.</p>
      <p n="23">2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, cut carnation flowers slightly contaminated by carnation leaf-rollers may be put into circulation from 16 October to 30 April.</p>
      <p n="24">Article 4</p>
      <p n="25">Member States shall prohibit the holding of carnation leaf-rollers.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 5</p>
      <p n="27">1. Member States may authorize: (a) derogations from the measures referred to in Articles 3 and 4 for scientific purposes, tests or selection work; (1)OJ No C 93, 7.8.1974, p. 87. (2)OJ No C 116, 30.9.1974, p. 49.</p>
      <p n="28">(b) that, notwithstanding Article 3, cut carnation flowers slightly contaminated by carnation leaf-rollers may be put into circulation from 1 May to 15 October.</p>
      <p n="29">2. Member States shall ensure that the authorizations referred to in paragraph 1 are granted only where adequate controls guarantee that they do not prejudice the control of carnation leaf-rollers and create no risk of the spread of these harmful organisms.</p>
      <p n="30">Article 6</p>
      <p n="31">Member States may adopt additional or stricter provisions to control carnation leaf-rollers or to prevent them from spreading insofar as such provisions are necessary for such control or prevention.</p>
      <p n="32">Article 7</p>
      <p n="33">Member States shall bring into force the measures needed to comply with this Directive not later than a year following its notification and forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="34">Article 8</p>
      <p n="35">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="36">Done at Brussels, 9 December 1974.</p>
      <p n="37">For the Council</p>
      <p n="38">The President</p>
