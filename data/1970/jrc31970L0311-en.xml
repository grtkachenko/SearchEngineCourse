      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">No Member State may refuse to grant EEC type approval or national type approval of a vehicle on grounds relating to its steering equipment if this equipment satisfies the requirements set out in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="15">Article 3</p>
      <p n="16">The amendments necessary for adjusting the requirements of the Annex so as to take account of technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of the Council Directive of 6 February 1970 on the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 4</p>
      <p n="18">1. Member States shall put into force the provisions containing the requirements needed in order to comply with this Directive within eighteen months of its notification and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="19">2. Member States shall ensure that the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive are communicated to the Commission.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 5</p>
      <p n="21">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="22">Done at Brussels, 8 June 1970.</p>

      <p n="26">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="27">1. DEFINITIONS 1.1 Steering equipment</p>
      <p n="28">"Steering equipment" means all the equipment the purpose of which is to alter the direction of movement of the vehicle.</p>
      <p n="29">The steering equipment may be considered to include: - the steering control;</p>
      <p n="30">- the steering gear;</p>
      <p n="31">- the steered wheels;</p>
      <p n="32">- where applicable, special equipment to produce additional or independent power</p>
      <p n="33">1.1.1 Steering control</p>
      <p n="34">"Steering control" means the part directly operated by the driver in order to steer the vehicle.</p>
      <p n="35">1.1.2 Steering gear 1.1.2.1 In the case of motor vehicles, "steering gear" means all the components between the steering control and the steered wheels, with the exception of the special equipment referred to in item 1.1.4. The steering gear may be mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electric or a combination of any of these.</p>
      <p n="36">1.1.2.2 In the case of trailers, "steering gear" means all the components which transmit to the steered wheels the force necessary in order to obtain a change in the direction of movement of the vehicle.</p>
      <p n="37">1.1.3 Steered wheels</p>
      <p n="38">"Steered wheels" means the wheels the alignment of which may be altered directly or indirectly in relation to that of the vehicle in order to obtain a change in the direction of movement of the vehicle.</p>
      <p n="39">1.1.4 Special equipment</p>
      <p n="40">"Special equipment" means that part of the steering equipment by which additional or independent power is produced. Additional or independent power may be produced by any mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic or electrical system, or by any combination of these (for example by an oil pump, air pump or battery).</p>
      <p n="41">1.2 Different types of steering equipment 1.2.1 Depending on the source of power which is necessary for the deflection of the steered wheels, the following types of steering equipment are distinguished: 1.2.1.1 manual steering equipment in which the steering power is provided solely by the muscular power of the driver;</p>
      <p n="42">1.2.1.2 assisted steering equipment in which the steering power is provided both by the muscular power of the driver and by the special equipment referred to in item 1.1.4.</p>
      <p n="43">1.2.1.3 servo-steering equipment in which the steering power is provided solely by the special equipment referred to in item 1.1.4.</p>
