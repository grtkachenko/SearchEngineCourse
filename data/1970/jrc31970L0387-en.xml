      <head n="1">Council Directive 70/387/EEC of 27 July 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the doors of motor vehicles and their trailers</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 27 July 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the doors of motor vehicles and their trailers (70/387/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the technical requirements which motor vehicles must satisfy pursuant to national laws relate, inter alia, to their doors;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas those requirements differ from one Member State to another ; whereas it is therefore necessary that all Member States adopt the same requirements either in addition to or in place of their existing rules, in order, in particular, to allow the EEC type approval procedure which was the subject of the Council Directive1 of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle;</p>
      <p n="9">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="10">Article 1</p>
      <p n="11">For the purposes of this Directive "vehicle" means any motor vehicle intended for use on the road, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h, and its trailers, with the exception of public transport vehicles, vehicles which run on rails, agricultural tractors and machinery and public works vehicles.</p>
      <p n="12">Article 2</p>
      <p n="13">No Member State may refuse to grant EEC type approval or national type approval of a vehicle on grounds relating to its doors if these satisfy the requirements set out in the Annexes.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 3</p>
      <p n="15">The amendments necessary for adjusting the requirements of the Annex so as to take account of technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of the Council Directive of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 4</p>
      <p n="17">1. Member States shall put into force the provisions containing the requirements needed in order to comply with this Directive within eighteen months of its notification and shall inform the Commission forthwith.</p>
      <p n="18">2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 5</p>
      <p n="20">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Done at Brussels, 27 July 1970.</p>
      <p n="22">For the Council</p>
      <p n="23">The President</p>
      <p n="24">W. ARENDT 1 OJ No L 42, 23.2.1970, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="25">ANNEX I</p>
      <p n="26">1. GENERAL 1.1 The design characteristics of the vehicle must permit entry to and exit from it in perfect safety.</p>
      <p n="27">1.2 Doors, entries and exits must be such that they can be used easily and without danger.</p>
      <p n="28">1.3 Doors and door latches must be designed in such a way that any irritating noise on closing may be avoided.</p>
      <p n="29">1.4 Door latches must be designed in such a way as to prevent the doors opening accidentally.</p>
      <p n="30">2. LATCHES AND HINGES (Construction and fitting requirements) 2.1 The hinges of hinge-mounted doors (with the exception of folding doors), when fitted to the sides of vehicles, must be fixed at the front edge of the doors in the direction of forward travel. In the case of double doors, this requirement applies to the door wing which opens first ; it must be possible to bolt the other wing of the door.</p>
      <p n="31">2.2 The latches and hinges of the side doors of private cars1 must satisfy the requirements set out in Annex II to this Directive.</p>
      <p n="32">3. RUNNING BOARDS (Construction and fitting requirements) 3.1 If the floor at the entrance to the vehicle is more than 700 mm above the ground, the vehicle must have one or more running boards. The running board, or lower running board if there are several, must not be more than 700 mm above the ground and must be constructed in such a way as to preclude the risk of slipping. The wheel hub, rims and other parts of the wheel shall not be deemed to be running boards for the purposes of this Directive, except where reasons relating to construction or use preclude the fitting of running boards elsewhere on the vehicle. 1 Class M1 of the International Classification set out in Note (b) to the Annex to the Council Directive referred to in Article 3 of this Directive.</p>
      <p n="33">ANNEX II CONSTRUCTION AND FITTING REQUIREMENTS AND STRENGTH TESTS FOR CATCHES AND HINGES ON SIDE DOORS FOR ENTRY TO OR EXIT FROM PRIVATE CARS</p>
      <p n="34">1. GENERAL 1.1 Latches and hinges must be so designed, constructed and fitted that in normal use, the vehicle satisfies the requirements of this Directive.</p>
      <p n="35">1.2 Each latch shall have both an intermediate latched position and a fully latched position.</p>
      <p n="36">2. PARTICULARS AND BATCHES OF LATCHES AND HINGES TO BE SUBMITTED BY THE MANUFACTURER OR HIS AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE.</p>
      <p n="37">The manufacturer or his authorised representative must submit the following particulars and batches of latches and hinges: 2.1 Drawings of the doors and of their latches and hinges on an appropriate scale and in sufficient detail;</p>
      <p n="38">2.2 A technical description of the latches and hinges;</p>
      <p n="39">2.3 A batch of five sets of hinges per door. Where, however, the same sets are used for several doors, it will be sufficient to submit one batch of sets. Sets of hinges which are distinguishable only because they are designed to be fitted on the left or on the right shall not be regarded as different;</p>
      <p n="40">2.4 A batch of five complete latches, including actuating mechanism, per door. Where, however, the same complete latches are used for several doors, it will be sufficient to submit one batch of such latches. Latches which are distinguishable only because they are designed to be fitted on the left or on the right shall not be regarded as different.</p>
      <p n="41">3. CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Latches 3.1.1 Longitudinal load</p>
      <p n="42">The latch and striker assembly shall be able to withstand a longitudinal load of 453 kp (444 daN) in the intermediate latched position and 1134 kp (1111 daN) in the fully latched position (Figure 2).</p>
