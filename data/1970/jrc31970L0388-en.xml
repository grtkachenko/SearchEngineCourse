IF THE MEMBER STATE WHICH HAS GRANTED EEC APPROVAL FINDS THAT A NUMBER OF AUDIBLE WARNING DEVICES BEARING THE SAME APPROVAL MARK DO NOT CONFORM TO THE TYPE WHICH IT HAS APPROVED , IT SHALL TAKE THE NECESSARY MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT PRODUCTION MODELS CONFORM TO THE APPROVED TYPE . THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES OF THAT STATE SHALL ADVISE THOSE OF THE OTHER MEMBER STATES OF THE MEASURES TAKEN , WHICH MAY , WHERE NECESSARY , EXTEND TO WITHDRAWAL OF EEC APPROVAL . THE SAID AUTHORITIES SHALL TAKE THE SAME MEASURES IF THEY ARE INFORMED BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE OF SUCH FAILURE TO CONFORM .</p>
      <p n="30">2 . THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES OF THE MEMBER STATES SHALL WITHIN ONE MONTH INFORM EACH OTHER OF ANY WITHDRAWAL OF EEC TYPE APPROVAL , AND OF THE REASONS FOR SUCH MEASURES .</p>

THE COMMISSION SHALL BE KEPT INFORMED AND SHALL , WHERE NECESSARY , HOLD APPROPRIATE CONSULTATIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REACHING A SETTLEMENT .</p>
      <p n="32">ARTICLE 6</p>
      <p n="33">ALL DECISIONS TAKEN PURSUANT TO THE RULES ADOPTED IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS DIRECTIVE AND REFUSING OR WITHDRAWING APPROVAL FOR AN AUDIBLE WARNING DEVICE OR PROHIBITING ITS MARKETING OR USE SHALL STATE IN DETAIL THE REASONS ON WHICH THEY ARE BASED .
