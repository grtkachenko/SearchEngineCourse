      <p n="8">Whereas the problems presented by the improvement of living and working conditions in modern society are increasingly numerous and complex ; whereas it is important that appropriate Community action should be built up on an inter-disciplinary scientific basis and at the same time that employers and workers should be associated in the action undertaken;</p>

      <p n="11">Whereas the Council resolution of 21 January 1974 (4) concerning a social action programme, lays down inter alia an action programme for workers, aimed at humanizing living and working conditions;</p>

      <p n="13">Whereas the powers required for the creation of such a Foundation are not provided for in the Treaty;</p>
