      <head n="1">Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75 of the Council of 29 October 1975 on the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks</head>
      <p n="2">REGULATION (EEC) No 2782/75 OF THE COUNCIL of 29 October 1975 on the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 (1) of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in eggs, and in particular Article 2 thereof;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 (2) of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat, and in particular Article 2 thereof;</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (3);</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in order to attain the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty with respect to poultry, Regulations (EEC) No 2771/75 and (EEC) No 2777/75 provide for measures to facilitate the adaptation of supply to demand;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas these measures include in particular those which are intended to facilitate the introduction of short and long term forecasts based on the knowledge of the production recourses employed and also marketing standards which may relate to packing, transport and marking;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas an exact knowledge of the number of incubated eggs, and of the number of chicks hatched, classified according to species, category and type of poultry, makes it possible to forecast the development of the market in poultry products ; whereas, to that end, provisions should also be made for the collection of statistics relating to flocks of grandparent stock and parent stock birds;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, in order to forecast market trends with the greatest possible accuracy and as soon as possible, the data relating to incubated eggs, chicks hatched and chicks marketed should be collected at regular intervals;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it is further necessary to identify eggs for hatching produced in the Community, so as to be able to distinguish them from the eggs subject to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2772/75 (4) of 29 October 1975 on marketing standards for eggs ; whereas, therefore, such identification must be made in the Community by the individual marking of eggs for hatching ; whereas, however, it is necessary to provide that, in the Member States which authorize it, this identification can be carried out according to special packing provisions ; whereas that latter possibility must not, however, result in the marketing without a special distinguishing mark of eggs which have been removed from the incubator;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the sluice-gate prices and levies are different for eggs for hatching and for other eggs ; whereas, it is necessary to enable a clear distinction between those products by marking eggs for hatching;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the same is true for exports, owing in particular to the provisions for granting refunds ; whereas, however, account must be taken, as far as possible, of the provisions which might exist as regards identification in third countries so as to avoid disrupting trade with those countries;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas a distinguishing number, given to each establishment and stamped on eggs for hatching or on packings containing eggs for hatching or chicks, may facilitate the marketing of these products and checking of compliance with the provisions of the Regulation;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas, both in respect of marketing and checking, it is essential to enter on the accompanying documents information relating in particular both to the nature of the batch of chicks or eggs for hatching and to its origin ; whereas, therefore, certain of these particulars must be shown on the packings; (1)See page 49 of this Official Journal. (2)See page 77 of this Official Journal. (3)OJ No C 128, 9.6.1975, p. 39. (4)See page 56 of this Official Journal.</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas the establishments in question must be assured that any specific information concerning them will benefit from anonymity and statistical secrecy;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas establishments which, owing to their slight commercial importance, have no appreciable influence on overall statistical results or on market developments should be exempted from the obligation to comply with this Regulation,</p>
      <p n="20">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
