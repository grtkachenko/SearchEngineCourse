      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the technical requirements with which tractors must comply pursuant to national laws relate, inter alia, to the suppression of radio interference;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas these requirements differ from one Member State to another ; whereas it is therefore necessary that all Member States adopt the same requirements either in addition to or in place of their existing rules, in particular to allow the EEC type approval procedure which was the subject of Council Directive 74/150/EEC (3) of 4 March 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type approval of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors to be applied in respect of each type of tractor,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">1. "Agricultural or forestry tractor" means any motor vehicle fitted with wheels or caterpillar tracks and having at least two axles, the main function of which lies in its tractive power and which is specially designed to tow, push, carry or power certain tools, machinery or trailers intended for agricultural or forestry use. It may be equipped to carry a load and passengers.</p>
      <p n="13">2. This Directive shall apply only to tractors defined in the preceding paragraph, fitted with pneumatic tyres, and which have two axles and a maximum design speed of between 6 and 25 km/h and a spark-ignition engine.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">No Member State may refuse to grant EEC type approval or national type approval of a tractor on grounds relating to the radio interference produced by the spark-ignition system of its propulsion engine if such tractors are fitted with interference suppression equipment meeting the requirements of the Annexes.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 3</p>
      <p n="17">No Member State may refuse the registration or prohibit the sale, entry into service or use of a tractor on grounds relating to the radio interference produced by the spark-ignition system of its propulsion engine if such tractors are fitted with interference suppression equipment meeting the requirements of the Annexes.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 4</p>
      <p n="19">A Member State which has granted type approval shall take the necessary measures to be informed of any modification of a part or characteristic referred to in 2.2 - Annex I. The competent authorities of that State shall determine whether fresh tests should be carried out on the modified type of the tractor and a fresh report drawn up. Where such tests reveal failure to comply with the requirements of this Directive, the modification shall not be approved. (1)OJ No C 160, 18.12.1969, p. 29. (2)OJ No C 48, 16.4.1969, p. 21. (3)OJ No L 84, 28.3.1974, p. 10.</p>

      <p n="78">(11.)</p>
      <p n="79">ANNEX II METHOD OF MEASUREMENT OF RADIO INTERFERENCE PRODUCED BY HIGH-VOLTAGE IGNITION SYSTEMS</p>
      <p n="80">1. MEASURING APPARATUS</p>
      <p n="81">The measuring equipment shall comply with the requirements of Publication No 2 (first edition, 1961) of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) or with the specifications applicable to peak type measuring apparatus given in CISPR Publication No 5 (first edition, 1967).</p>
      <p n="82">Note:</p>
      <p n="83">Where the available equipment does not fully meet all the CISPR specifications, discrepancies must be clearly stated.</p>
      <p n="84">2. EXPRESSION OF RESULTS</p>
      <p n="85">The results of measurements must be expressed in ¶V/m for 120 kHz bandwidth. For statistical purposes, the logarithmic unit dB (¶V/m) shall be used. If for certain frequencies the actual bandwidth B (expressed in kHz) of the measuring apparatus differs slightly from 120 kHz, the readings taken should be converted to 120 kHz bandwidth through multiplication &gt;PIC FILE= "T0006923"&gt;</p>
      <p n="86">3. MEASURING SITE</p>
      <p n="87">The measuring site shall be a level area free from appreciable wave-reflecting surfaces within an ellipse having a major axis of 20 m and a minor axis of 17 73 m. The antenna and the centre of the engine must be located on the major axis of the ellipse, the plane of symmetry of the tractor being parallel to the minor axis. The antenna and the point of intersection of the side of the engine nearest to the antenna with the major axis must each be located at a focal point of the ellipse. The measuring set, or the test hut or vehicle in which the set is located, may be within the ellipse but horizontally not closer than 3 m to the antenna, in a direction opposite to the tractor being measured. Furthermore, the absence of any extraneous or signal which could materially affect the measurement must be ensured ; a check is therefore made, with the engine stopped, before and after taking the measurements, which can be considered satisfactory only if the readings are at least 10 dB above the highest obtained at the pre- and post-measurement checks.</p>
      <p n="88">4. TRACTOR 4.1. Only the ancillary electrical equipment necessary for the running of the engine shall be operating.</p>
      <p n="89">4.2. The engine shall be at its normal operating temperature. During each measurement, the engine shall be operated as follows: &gt;PIC FILE= "T0006891"&gt;</p>
      <p n="90">4.3. Measurements shall not be made while rain is falling on the vehicle or within 10 minutes after rain has stopped.</p>
      <p n="91">5. ANTENNA 5.1. Height</p>
      <p n="92">The centre of the dipole shall be 3 m above the ground.</p>
      <p n="93">5.2. Distance of measurement</p>
      <p n="94">The horizontal distance from the antenna to the nearest metal part of the tractor shall be 10 m.</p>
      <p n="95">5.3. Antenna location relative to tractor</p>
      <p n="96">The antenna shall be placed successively on the left- and right-hand sides of the tractor at two positions of measurement, with the aerial parallel to the plane of symmetry of the tractor and in line with the engine. (See Appendix to this Annex).</p>
      <p n="97">5.4. Antenna position</p>
      <p n="98">At each of the measuring points, readings shall be taken with the dipole in a horizontal and in a vertical position. (See Appendix to this Annex).</p>
      <p n="99">5.5.Readings</p>
      <p n="100">The maximum of four readings shall be taken as the characteristic reading at the frequency at which the measurements were made.</p>
      <p n="101">6.FREQUENCIES</p>
      <p n="102">Measurements shall be made within the 40 to 250 MHz range. A tractor is considered as very likely to meet the required suppression limits over the whole frequency range if it meets them at the following six frequencies : 45, 65, 90, 150, 180 and 220 (± 5 MHz) (The 5 MHz tolerance for the six frequencies chosen should make it possible to avoid interference from transmissions operating on the nominal frequencies).</p>
      <p n="103">Appendix</p>
      <p n="104">ANTENNA DIRECTION RELATIVE TO TRACTOR Example</p>
      <p n="105">&gt;PIC FILE= "T0006893"&gt; Plan</p>
      <p n="106">Dipole antenna in position to measure horizontal component of the radiation</p>
      <p n="107">&gt;PIC FILE= "T0006894"&gt; Elevation</p>
      <p n="108">Dipole antenna in position to measure horizontal component of the radiation</p>
      <p n="109">ANNEX III STATISTICAL METHOD OF CHECKING RADIO INTERFERENCE SUPPRESSION</p>
      <p n="110">In order to ensure with an 80 % probability that 80 % of the vehicles conform to a specified limit L, the following condition must be satisfied: &gt;PIC FILE= "T0006895"&gt;</p>
      <p n="111">If a first sample of n tractors does not meet the specification, a second sample of n tractors shall be tested and the overall results assessed as coming from a sample of 2n tractors.</p>
