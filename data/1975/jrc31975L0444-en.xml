      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 26 June 1975 amending Directives No 66/400/EEC, No 66/401/EEC, No 66/402/EEC, No 66/403/EEC and No 69/208/EEC on the marketing of beet seed, fodder plant seed, cereal seed, seed potatoes, and seed of oil and fibre plants (75/444/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, for the reasons given below, certain Directives on the marketing of seeds should be amended;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas it has become apparent, in the course of applying the Directives, that small packages of beet seed and fodder plant seed form an item of trade within the Community;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas it accordingly seems appropriate to harmonize this sector which has hitherto been covered by national legislation;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas in this connection it seems advisable, on the one hand, to facilitate the marking and sealing of such small packages, and on the other hand to make adequate control compulsory for identifying the seed;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas certain of the abovementioned Directives provide that from 1 July 1975 the equivalance of seed harvested in other countries, particularly in third countries, can no longer be established nationally by Member States ; whereas, however, since it has not been possible to carry out Community examination for seed of fodder, oil and fibre plants in all cases, the abovementioned period should be extended for these seeds in order to avoid disturbing current commercial relations;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it is advisable to authorize Member States to introduce provisions facilitating the sealing of small packages containing cereal seed, seed potatoes and seed of oil and fibre plants;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas it is also necessary to make certain corrections to the way in which the quantities of seed are specified;</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
