      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE of 25 July 1975 adapting to technical progress Council Directive No 71/320/EEC of 26 July 1971 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the braking devices of certain categories of motor vehicles and of their trailers (75/524/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive No 70/156/EEC (1) of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, as amended by the Act (2) annexed to the Treaty concerning the accession of the new Member States to the EEC and EAEC signed in Brussels on 22 January 1972, and in particular to Articles 11, 12 and 13 thereof;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Directive No 71/320/EEC (3) of 26 July 1971 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the braking devices of certain categories of motor vehicles and of their trailers, as amended by the Act (4) annexed to the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the EEC and EAEC signed in Brussels on 22 January 1972, and in particular to Article 5 thereof;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas in Directive No 74/132/EEC (5) of 11 February 1974, the Commission adopted provisions adapting to technical progress the Council Directive of 26 July 1971 mentioned above ; whereas these provisions solely relate to braking-pressure distributors and not, therefore, to conditions of compatibility ; whereas in order to avoid certain combinations of vehicles (drawing and drawn vehicles) which are not likely to be able to provide every guarantee of safety from the point of view of braking, these provisions should be subject to conditions of compatibility between drawing and drawn vehicles ; whereas technical progress now enables provisions on compatibility not only to be adopted but also enables them to be correctly implemented;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the laying down of provisions on the conditions of compatibility necessitates amendments to the provisions relating to the device which enables the braking pressure to be matched to the load and which are set out in the Annex to Council Directive No 74/132/EEC;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the provisions relating to wheel anti-locking systems will be adopted at a later date ; whereas, until the entry into force of these provisions, it is consequently necessary to subject vehicles of all categories, with the exception of those in categories O1 and O2, to the provisions of this Directive, even if they are fitted with wheel anti-locking devices;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas this Directive provides for an earlier date of entry into force of the amended provisions and whereas it is therefore no longer justified to retain the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 2 of Commission Directive No 74/132/EEC;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the provisions of this Directive are in accordance with the Opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives aimed at the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Motor-Vehicle Sector, (1)OJ No L 42, 23.2.1970, p. 1. (2)OJ No L 73, 27.3.1972, pp. 115 and 157. (3)OJ No L 202, 6.9.1971, p. 37. (4)OJ No L 73, 27.3.1972, pp. 118, 119 and 158. (5)OJ No L 74, 19.3.1974, p. 7.</p>

      <p n="17">2. Pending the entry into force of special requirements on wheel anti-locking systems, vehicles of categories M1, M2, M3, N1, N2, N3, O3 and O4 which are fitted with these systems are submitted to the prescriptions of this Directive.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 3</p>
