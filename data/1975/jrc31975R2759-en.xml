      <head n="1">Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of the Council of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat</head>
      <p n="2">REGULATION (EEC) No 2759/75 OF THE COUNCIL of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas since their adoption the basic provisions concerning the organization of the market in pigmeat have been amended a number of times ; whereas, by reason of their number, their complexity and their dispersal among various Official Journals, the relevant texts are difficult to use and thus lack the clarity which should be an essential feature of all legislation ; whereas they should therefore be consolidated in a single text;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the operation and development of the common market in agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy to include in particular a common organization of agricultural markets, which may take various forms depending on the product;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the aim of the common agricultural policy is to attain the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty ; whereas, in the pigmeat sector, in order to stabilize markets and to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community concerned, provision should be made for measures to facilitate the adjustment of supply to market requirements and for intervention measures ; whereas the latter may take the form of buying in by intervention agencies ; whereas, however, aid should also be provided for private storage since such aid least disturbs the normal marketing of products and can help to reduce the volume of buying in by intervention agencies ; whereas to this end provision should be made in particular for the fixing of a basic price at which intervention measures may come into operation, and the conditions governing intervention should be specified;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the creation of a single Community market for pigmeat involves the introduction of a single trading system at the external frontiers of the Community ; whereas a trading system including levies and export refunds, combined with intervention measures, also serves to stabilize the Community market, in particular by preventing price fluctuations on the world market from affecting prices ruling within the Community;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas to achieve this aim it should as a general rule be sufficient to introduce, in respect of imports from third countries, levies which take account of the incidence on feeding costs of the difference between prices for feed grain within the Community and on the world market, and of the need to protect the Community processing industry;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas it is necessary to avoid disturbances on the Community market caused by offers made on the world market at abnormally low prices ; whereas to this end sluice-gate prices should be fixed and levies should be increased by an additional amount when free-at-frontier offer prices are lower than those prices ; whereas the system of sluice-gate prices will not operate, however, where it is difficult to determine a sufficiently representative offer price for all the products falling within one Tariff heading ; whereas provision should be made for a method of calculating the additional amount in such cases;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, in order that a check may be kept on the volume of imports, provision should be made for a system of import licences involving the provision of security as a guarantee that importation will be effected; (1)OJ No C 60, 13.3.1975, p. 42.</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas provision for a refund on exports to third countries equal to the difference between prices within the Community and on the world market would serve to safeguard Community participation in international trade in pigmeat ; whereas, in order to give Community exporters a certain amount of security as regards the stability of refunds, provision should be made to enable refunds in the pigmeat sector to be fixed in advance;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas, in addition to the system described above, provision should be made for prohibiting in whole or in part, when the situation on the market so requires, the use of inward processing arrangements;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas the levy system makes it possible to dispense with all other protective measures at the external frontiers of the Community ; whereas, however, the common price and levy machinery may, in exceptional circumstances, prove defective ; whereas in such cases, so as not to leave the Community market without defence against disturbances which may arise therefrom after the import barriers which existed previously have been removed, the Community should be enabled to take all necessary measures without delay;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas restrictions on free circulation resulting from the application of measures intended to prevent the spread of animal disease may cause difficulties on the market of one or more Member States ; whereas provision should be made for the introduction of exceptional measures of market support to remedy such a situation;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas, in order to facilitate implementation of the proposed measures, a procedure should be provided for establishing close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission within a Management Committee;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas the establishment of a single market based on a common price system would be jeopardized by the granting of certain aids ; whereas, therefore, the provisions of the Treaty which allow the assessment of aids granted by Member States and the prohibition of those which are incompatible with the common market should be made to apply to pigmeat;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas the common organization of the market in pigmeat must take account, in appropriate manner and at the same time, of the objectives set out in Articles 39 and 110 of the Treaty;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas the expenditure incurred by the Member States as a result of the obligations arising out of the application of this Regulation fall on the Community in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 (1) of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1566/72 (2),</p>

      <p n="98">For certain of the products for which no sluice-gate price is fixed, a system of "pilot products" and "derived products" shall be established to enable additional amounts to be fixed.</p>
      <p n="99">2. However, the levy shall not be increased by the aforesaid additional amount as regards third countries which are prepared and in a position to guarantee that the price for imports into the Community of products originating in and coming from their territory will not be lower than the sluice-gate price for the product in question and that any deflection of trade will be avoided.</p>
      <p n="100">3. The free-at-frontier offer price shall be determined for all imports from all third countries.</p>
      <p n="101">However, if exports from one or more third countries are effected at abnormally low prices, lower than the prices ruling in other countries, a second free-at-frontier offer price shall be determined for exports from these other countries.</p>

      <p n="107">Such licence shall be valid for an importation carried out anywhere in the Community.</p>
      <p n="108">The issue of such licences shall be conditional on the provision of security as a guarantee that importation will be effected during the period of validity of the licence ; the security shall be wholly or partially forfeit if importation is not effected, or is only partially effected, within that period.</p>
      <p n="109">2. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt a list of the products for which import licences are required.</p>
