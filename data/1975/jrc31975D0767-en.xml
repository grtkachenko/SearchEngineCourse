      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the Member States are Contracting Parties to the Convention of 15 December 1950 on the Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs (the Brussels Nomenclature);</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas they have also accepted the Customs Cooperation Council's recommendation of 8 December 1960 on the correlation between the Brussels Nomenclature and the revised Standard International Trade Classification, adopted during 1960 by the United Nations Economic and Social Council ; whereas the statistics relating to the external trade of the Community and to trade between Member States must therefore follow the Brussels Nomenclature in its present or future form so that the statistical data relating to the external trade of the Community and to trade between Member States can be furnished on the basis of these two international nomenclatures;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas a second version of the said classification was adopted by the Statistical Commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council at its October 1974 session;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas on 1 January 1975 the Customs Cooperation Council addressed a recommendation to States which are members thereof and to the customs and economic unions set up by certain of them, to incorporate in their customs tariffs or in their statistical nomenclatures the subheadings listed in the Annex to the said recommendation or, at least, to take appropriate steps to enable statistical data to be reported to the United Nations bodies concerned on the basis of these subheadings,</p>
      <p n="11">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="12">Sole Article</p>
