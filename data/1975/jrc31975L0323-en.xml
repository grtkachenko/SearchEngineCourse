      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 20 May 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the power connection fitted on wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors for lighting and light-signalling devices on tools, machinery or trailers intended for agriculture or forestry (75/323/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof;</p>

      <p n="7">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the technical requirements with which tractors must comply pursuant to national laws relate, inter alia, to the power connection for lighting and light-signalling devices on tools, machinery or trailers;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas these requirements differ from one Member State to another ; whereas it is therefore necessary that all Member States adopt the same requirements either in addition to or in place of their existing rules, in particular to allow the EEC type approval procedure which was the subject of Council Directive 74/150/EEC (3) of 4 March 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type approval of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors to be applied in respect of each type of tractor;</p>

It may be equipped to carry a load and passengers.</p>
      <p n="14">2. This Directive shall apply only to tractors defined in the preceding paragraph which are fitted with pneumatic tyres and which have two axles and a maximum design speed of between 6 and 25 kilometres per hour.</p>
      <p n="15">Article 2</p>
      <p n="16">No Member State may refuse to grant EEC type approval or national type approval of a tractor on grounds relating to the power connection for lighting and light-signalling devices on tools, machinery or trailers if the tractor is fitted with a power connection which satisfies the requirements set out in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 3</p>
      <p n="18">No Member State may refuse the registration or prohibit the sale, entry into service or use of tractors on grounds relating to the power connections for lighting and light-signalling devices on tools, machinery or trailers if the tractors are fitted with power connections which satisfy the requirements set out in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 4</p>

      <p n="25">Article 6</p>
      <p n="26">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="27">Done at Brussels, 20 May 1975.</p>
      <p n="28">For the Council</p>
      <p n="29">The President</p>
      <p n="30">R. RYAN</p>
      <p n="31">ANNEX</p>
