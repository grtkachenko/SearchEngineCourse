      <p n="11">(2) It is necessary to include updated standard information for contaminants in food, in particular to take into account the measurement uncertainty for analysis.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) It is of major importance that analytical results are reported and interpreted in a uniform way in order to ensure a harmonised enforcement approach across the European Union.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) Directive 2001/22/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>

      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
