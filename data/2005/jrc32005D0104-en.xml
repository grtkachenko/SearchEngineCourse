      <p n="3">of 3 February 2005</p>

      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products [1], and in particular Article 5 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Commission Decision 2002/300/EC of 18 April 2002 establishing the list of approved zones with regard to Bonamia ostreae and/or Marteilia refringens [2], lays down the areas in the Community considered to be free of the mollusc diseases Bonamia ostreae and/or Marteilia refringens.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Denmark has submitted justifications for obtaining the status of an approved zone with regard to Bonamia ostreae and Marteilia refringens, for the zone of Limfjorden. The documentation provided shows that that zone meets the requirements of Directive 91/67/EEC. It therefore qualifies for the status of approved zone and should be added to the list of approved zones set out in Decision 2002/300/EC.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) In addition, Ireland has submitted a request for an amendment to be made to the list of zones in Ireland approved with regard to Bonamia ostreae in Decision 2002/300/EC, in order that the geographical description of one of the areas affected by that disease is made more precise. Accordingly, the description "Logmore, Belmullet" should be substituted for "Loughmore, Blacksod Bay".</p>
      <p n="15">(4) Decision 2002/300/EC should be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
      <p n="19">The Annex to Decision 2002/300/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
