      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>

      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Commission Decision 2003/634/EC [2] approves and lists programmes submitted by various Member States. The programmes are designed to enable the Member State subsequently to initiate the procedures for a zone, or a farm situated in a non-approved zone, to obtain the status of approved zone or of approved farm situated in a non approved zone, as regards one or more of the fish diseases viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN).</p>
      <p n="13">(2) By letter dated 20 April 2004, Cyprus applied for approval of the programme to be applied in the entire territory of Cyprus. The application submitted has been found to comply with Article 10 of Directive 91/67/EEC and the programme should therefore be approved.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The programmes applicable to the Zona Val Brembana and to the farm Azienda Troticoltura S. Cristina in Italy have been finalised. Therefore, they should be deleted from Annexes I and II to Decision 2003/634/EC.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) Decision 2003/634/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>

      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
      <p n="19">Decision 2003/634/EC is amended as follows:</p>
