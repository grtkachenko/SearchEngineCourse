      <p n="12">(1) In Commission Decision 98/695/EC [2], the "Dirección General de Control Sanitario de Productos y Servicios (DGCSPS) de la Secretaría de Salud" is identified as the competent authority in Mexico for verifying and certifying compliance of fishery and aquaculture products with the requirements of Directive 91/493/EEC.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Following a restructuring of the Mexican administration, the competent authority has changed to the "Comisión Federal para la Protección contra Riesgos Sanitarios (CFPRS)". This new authority is capable of effectively verifying the application of the rules in force.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The CFPRS has provided official assurances on compliance with the standards for health controls and monitoring of fishery and aquaculture products as set out in Directive 91/493/EEC and on the fulfilment of hygienic requirements equivalent to those laid down in that Directive.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) Decision 98/695/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
