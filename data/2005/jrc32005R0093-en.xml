      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 93/2005</p>
      <p n="3">of 19 January 2005</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards processing of animal by-products of fish origin and commercial documents for the transportation of animal by-products</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption [1], and in particular Article 32(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Annex V, Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 sets out the processing methods for animal by-products. For animal by-products of fish origin processing method 6 is provided for in that Chapter but the processing parameters are not specified.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) The Scientific Steering Committee has issued a number of opinions addressing the safety of animal by-products including fish. According to those opinions the risk of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) arising from animal by-products of fish origin is negligible.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) The Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare adopted a report on the use of fish by-products in aquaculture at its meeting of 26 February 2003.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) It is appropriate to lay down the requirements for the processing of animal by-products of fish origin in line with those opinions and reports.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) It is appropriate to lay down different processing methods for materials likely to contain high or low numbers of pathogens, excluding bacterial spores.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) Annex II, Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 provides for a commercial document to accompany animal by-products and processed products during transportation. It is appropriate to lay down a model for that commercial document.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
      <p n="18">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="19">Article 1</p>
      <p n="20">Annexes V and II to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="23">It shall apply from 1 January 2005.</p>
      <p n="24">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="25">Done at Brussels, 19 January 2005.</p>
