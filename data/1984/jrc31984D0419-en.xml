      <p n="3">COMMISSION DECISION</p>
      <p n="4">of 19 July 1984</p>
      <p n="5">laying down the criteria for entering cattle in herd-books</p>
      <p n="6">(84/419/EEC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN</p>
      <p n="8">COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 77/504/EEC of 25 July 1977 on pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece, and in particular the fourth indent of Article 6 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, under the fourth indent of Article 6 (1) of Directive 77/504/EEC, it is for the Commission to determine, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of that Directive, the harmonized criteria governing the entry of cattle in herd-books;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas in all the Member States with the exception at present of Greece herd-books are maintained or established by breeders' organizations and associations;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it is therefore necessary to lay down the criteria for the entering of cattle in herd-books;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas precise conditions relating to lineage and identification must be fulfilled prior to entry in the herd-book;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas allowance should be made for the division of the herd-book into different sections and classes so that certain types of animals will not be excluded;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Zootechnics,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
      <p n="19">To qualify for entry in the main section of the herd-book of its breed an animal must:</p>
      <p n="20">- be descended from parents and grandparents entered in a herd-book of that same breed,</p>
      <p n="21">- be identified at birth according to the rules of that book,</p>
      <p n="22">- have a pedigree established in accordance with the rules of that herd-book.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 2</p>
      <p n="24">The main section of a herd-book may be divided into several classes according to the animals' merits. Only cattle meeting the criteria laid down in Article 1 may be entered in one of those classes.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 3</p>
      <p n="26">1. A breeders' organization or association keeping a herd-book may decide that a female, which does not meet the criteria laid down in Article 1, may be entered in a supplementary section of that herd-book. The female must meet the following requirements:</p>
      <p n="27">- be identified in accordance with the herd-book rules,</p>
      <p n="28">- be judged to conform to the breed standard,</p>
      <p n="29">- have a minimum performance criteria as laid down by the herd-book rules.</p>
      <p n="30">2. The requirements mentioned in the second and third indents of paragraph 1 may be differentiated according to whether the female belongs to the breed although it has no known origin or was obtained from a crossing programme approved by the breeders' organization or association managing the herd-book.</p>
      <p n="31">Article 4</p>
      <p n="32">A female whose mother and maternal grandmother are entered in a supplementary section of the herd-book as provided for in Article 3 (1) and whose father and two grandfathers are entered in the main section of the book in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 1, shall be regarded as a pure-bred female and entered in the main section of the book, provided for in Article 1.</p>
      <p n="33">Article 5</p>
      <p n="34">Where a book contains several classes in the main section, an animal from another Member State shall be entered in the class of the book whose criteria it meets.</p>
      <p n="35">Article 6</p>
      <p n="36">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="37">Done at Brussels, 19 July 1984.</p>
