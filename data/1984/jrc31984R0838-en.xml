      <p n="3">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 838/84</p>
      <p n="4">of 30 March 1984</p>
      <p n="5">amending Regulation (EEC) No 3136/78 laying down detailed rules for fixing the import levy on olive oil by tender</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN</p>
      <p n="7">COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1413/82 (2), and in particular Article 16 (6) thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3136/78 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 134/84 (4), provides that the tendering procedure shall apply only to applications for import licences for quantities of more than 5 250 kilograms of the product concerned by the said applications; whereas for quantities of not more than 5 000 kilograms the levy to be applied is the minimum one in force on the day of importation for each of the categories of olive oil concerned; whereas experience has shown that these figures have been set at a level exceeding that as from which there is a danger of this procedure being used to evade the normal system of fixing the import levy by tendering procedure; whereas the provision in question should therefore be adjusted to reduce the maximum amount for which the simplified procedure is used;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">Regulation (EEC) No 3136/78 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="15">1. In Article 6 (1) '5 250 kilograms' is replaced by '10 500 kilograms'.</p>
      <p n="16">2. In Article 6 (3) '5 000 kilograms' is replaced by '10 000 kilograms'.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 April 1984.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="20">Done at Brussels, 30 March 1984.</p>
