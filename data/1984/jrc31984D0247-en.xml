      <p n="3">COMMISSION DECISION</p>
      <p n="4">of 27 April 1984</p>
      <p n="5">laying down the criteria for the recognition of breeders' organizations and associations which maintain or establish herd-books for pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species</p>
      <p n="6">(84/247/EEC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN</p>
      <p n="8">COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 77/504/EEC of 25 July 1977 on pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece, and in particular the second and third indents of Article 6 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, under the second and third indents of Article 6 (1) of Directive 77/504/EEC it is for the Commission to determine, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of the abovementioned Directive, the criteria governing the recognition of breeders' organizations and associations and the criteria governing the establishment of herd-books;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas in all the Member States, with the exception at present of Greece, herd-books are maintained or established by breeders' organizations and associations; whereas it is therefore necessary to lay down the criteria for the recognition of breeders' organizations and associations which maintain or establish herd-books;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas a breeders' organization or association must apply for official recognition to the competent authorities of the Member State on whose territory its headquarters are situated;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, where a breeders' organization or association meets certain criteria and has defined targets, it must be officially recognized by the authorities of the Member State to which it has applied;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Zootechnics,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">In order to be officially recognized, a breeders' organization or association which maintains or establishes herd-books must submit an application to the authorities of the Member State on whose territory its headquarters are situated.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">The authorities of the Member State concerned must grant official recognition to any breeders' organization or association which maintains or establishes herd-books if the latter meet the conditions laid down in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="21">However, in a Member State in which in respect of a given breed one or more officially recognized organizations or associations already exists, the authorities of the Member State concerned may refuse to recognize a new breeders' organization or association if it endangers the preservation of the breed or jeopardizes the zootechnical programme of the existing organization or association. In such a case, the Member States shall inform the Commission of approvals granted and refusals to give recognition.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 3</p>
      <p n="23">The authorities of the Member State concerned shall withdraw official recognition from any breeders' organization or association which maintains herd-books if the conditions laid down in the Annex are no longer being fulfilled in a persistent manner by the breeders' organization or association concerned.</p>
      <p n="24">Article 4</p>
      <p n="25">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="26">Done at Brussels, 27 April 1984.</p>

      <p n="38">that it has a sufficiently large herd to preserve the breed where this is considered necessary;</p>
      <p n="39">(d) that it can make use of the livestock performance data necessary for carrying out its breed improvement or preservation programme;</p>
      <p n="40">3. have a set of rules covering:</p>
