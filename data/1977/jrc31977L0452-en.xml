      <head n="1">Council Directive 77/452/EEC of 27 June 1977 concerning the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of the formal qualifications of nurses responsible for general care, including measures to facilitate the effective exercise of this right of establishment and freedom to provide services</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 27 June 1977 concerning the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of the formal qualifications of nurses responsible for general care, including measures to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment and freedom to provide services (77/452/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 49, 57, 66 and 235 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, pursuant to the Treaty, all discriminatory treatment based on nationality with regard to establishment and provision of services is prohibited as from the end of the transitional period ; whereas the principle of such treatment based on nationality applies in particular to the grant of any authorization required to practise as a nurse responsible for general care and also to the registration with or membership of professional organizations or bodies;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas it nevertheless seems desirable that certain provisions be introduced to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of the activities of nurses responsible for general care;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, pursuant to the Treaty, the Member States are required not to grant any form of aid likely to distort the conditions of establishment;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas Article 57 (1) of the Treaty provides that Directives be issued for mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas it would appear advisable that, contemporaneously with the mutual recognition of diplomas, provision should be made for coordinating the conditions governing the training of nurses responsibles for general care ; whereas such coordination is the subject of Directive 77/453/EEC (3);</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas in several Member States the law makes the right to take up and pursue the activities of a (1)OJ No C 65, 5.6.1970, p. 12. (2)OJ No C 108, 26.8.1970, p. 23. (3)See page 8 of this Official Journal.</p>
      <p n="14">nurse responsible for general care dependent upon the possession of a nursing diploma ; whereas in certain other Member States where this requirement does not exist, the right to use the title of nurse responsible for general care is nevertheless governed by law;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas, with regard to the possession of a formal certificate of training, since a Directive on the mutual recognition of diplomas does not necessarily imply equivalence in the training covered by such diplomas ; the use of such qualifications should be authorized only in the language of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas, to facilitate the application of this Directive by the national authorities, Member States may prescribe that, in addition to formal certificates of training, the person who satisfies the conditions of training required by this Directive must provide a certificate from the competent authorities of his country of origin or of the country from which he comes stating that these certificates of training are those covered by the Directive;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas, with regard to the requirements relating to good character and good repute, a distinction should be drawn between the requirements to be satisfied on first taking up the profession and those to be satisfied to practise it;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas, in the case of the provision of services, the requirement of registration with or membership of professional organizations or bodies, since it is related to the fixed and permanent nature of the activity pursued in the host country, would undoubtedly constitute an obstacle to the person wishing to provide the service, by reason of the temporary nature of his activity ; whereas this requirement should therefore be abolished ; whereas, however, in this event, control over professional discipline, which is the responsibility of these professional organizations or bodies, should be guaranteed ; whereas, to this end, it should be provided, subject to the application of Article 62 of the Treaty, that the person concerned may be required to submit to the competent authority of the host Member State particulars relating to the provision of services;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas, as far as the activities of employed nurses responsible for general care are concerned, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (1) lays down no specific provisions relating to good character or good repute, professional discipline or use of title for the professions covered ; whereas, depending on the individual Member State, such rules are or may be applicable both to employed and self-employed persons ; whereas the activities of a nurse responsible for general care are subject in several Member States to possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification in nursing ; whereas such activities are pursued by both employed and self-employed persons, or by the same persons in both capacities in the course of their professional career ; whereas, in order to encourage as far as possible the free movement of those professional persons within the Community, it therefore appears necessary to extend this Directive to employed nurses,</p>
      <p n="20">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="21">CHAPTER I SCOPE</p>

      <p n="75">CHAPTER V PROVISIONS TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF ESTABLISHMENT AND FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN RESPECT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF NURSES RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERAL CARE</p>

      <p n="77">Article 6</p>
      <p n="78">1. A host Member State which requires of its nationals proof of good character or good repute when they take up for the first time any activity referred to in Article 1 shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of other Member States, a certificate issued by a competent authority in the Member State of origin or in the Member State from which the foreign national comes attesting that the requirements of the Member State as to good character or good repute for taking up the activity in question have been met.</p>
      <p n="79">2. Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not require proof of good character or good repute of persons wishing to take up the activity in question for the first time, the host Member State may require of nationals of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes an extract from the "judicial record" or, failing this, an equivalent document issued by a competent authority in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes.</p>

      <p n="87">3. Member States shall ensure the confidentiality of the information which is forwarded.</p>

      <p n="94">1. The procedure for authorizing the person concerned to take up any activity referred to in Article 1, pursuant to Articles 6, 7 and 8, must be completed as soon as possible and not later than three months after presentation of all the documents relating to such person, without prejudice to delays resulting from any appeal that may be made upon the termination of this procedure.</p>
      <p n="95">2. In the cases referred to in Articles 6 (3) and 7 (2), a request for re-examination shall suspend the period stipulated in paragraph 1.</p>
