      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas one of the tasks of the Community in the veterinary field is to improve the state of health of livestock, and thus to make stock-breeding more profitable, while also protecting man against certain diseases which are communicable to him;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas such measures must contribute to the abolition of barriers to trade in fresh meat or live animals between Member States, which are due to differences in health situations;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Community initiatives to this effect must initially concentrate on certain diseases against which immediate action is possible ; whereas this is true of brucellosis, tuberculosis and leucosis;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas in so far as the proposed measures are intended to achieve the objectives set out in Article 39 (1) (a) of the Treaty they shall constitute common measures within the meaning of Article 6 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (3);</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, in as much as the Community contributes to the financing of the common measures, it must be in a position to ascertain that the provisions adopted by Member States for the implementation of those measures will contribute towards achievement of the objectives thereof ; whereas, to this end, provision should be made for a procedure establishing close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within the Standing Veterinary Committee, set up by Decision 68/361/EEC (4),</p>
