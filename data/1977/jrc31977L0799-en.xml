      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 19 December 1977 concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation (77/799/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas practices of tax evasion and tax avoidance extending across the frontiers of Member States lead to budget losses and violations of the principle of fair taxation and are liable to bring about distortions of capital movements and of conditions of competition ; whereas they therefore affect the operation of the common market;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, for these reasons the Council adopted on 10 February 1975 a resolution on the measures to be taken by the Community in order to combat international tax evasion and avoidance (3);</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the international nature of the problem means that national measures, whose effect does not extend beyond national frontiers, are insufficient ; whereas collaboration between administrations on the basis of bilateral agreements is also unable to counter new forms of tax evasion and avoidance, which are increasingly assuming a multinational character;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas collaboration between tax administrations within the Community should therefore be strengthened in accordance with common principles and rules;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the Member States should, on request, exchange information concerning particular cases ; whereas the State so requested should make the necessary enquiries to obtain such information;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the Member States should exchange, even without any request, any information which appears relevant for the correct assessment of taxes on income and on capital, in particular where there appears to be an artificial transfer of profits between enterprises in different Member States or where such transactions are carried out between enterprises in two Member States through a third country in order to obtain tax advantages, or where tax has been or may be evaded or avoided for any reason whatever;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas it is important that officials of the tax administration of one Member State be allowed to be present in the territory of another Member State if both the States concerned consider it desirable; (1)OJ No C 293, 13.12.1976, p. 34. (2)OJ No C 56, 7.3.1977, p. 66. (3)OJ No C 35, 14.2.1975, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas care must be taken to ensure that information provided in the course of such collaboration is not disclosed to unauthorized persons, so that the basic rights of citizens and enterprises are safeguarded ; whereas it is therefore necessary that the Member States receiving such information should not use it, without the authorization of the Member State supplying it, other than for the purposes of taxation or to facilitate legal proceedings for failure to observe the tax laws of the receiving State ; whereas it is also necessary that the receiving States afford the information the same degree of confidentiality which it enjoyed in the State which provided it, if the latter so requires;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas a Member State which is called upon to carry out enquiries or to provide information shall have the right to refuse to do so where its laws or administrative practices prevent its tax administration from carrying out these enquiries or from collecting or using this information for its own purposes, or where the provision of such information would be contrary to public policy or would lead to the disclosure of a commercial, industrial or professional secret or of a commercial process, or where the Member State for which the information is intended is unable for practical or legal reasons to provide similar information;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas collaboration between the Member States and the Commission is necessary for the permanent study of cooperation procedures and the pooling of experience in the fields considered, and in particular in the field of the artificial transfer of profits within groups of enterprises, with the aim of improving those procedures and of preparing appropriate Community rules,</p>
      <p n="18">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>

The competent authority of the requested State need not comply with the request if it appears that the competent authority of the State making the request has not exhausted its own usual sources of information, which it could have utilized, according to the circumstances, to obtain the information requested without running the risk of endangering the attainment of the sought after result.</p>
      <p n="100">2. For the purpose of forwarding the information referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authority of the requested Member State shall arrange for the conduct of any enquiries necessary to obtain such information.</p>

      <p n="110">(e) information forwarded to the one Member State by the competent authority of the other Member State has enabled information to be obtained which may be relevant in assessing liability to tax in the latter Member State.</p>

      <p n="117">Collaboration by officials of the State concerned</p>

      <p n="126">3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the Member State providing the information may permit it to be used for other purposes in the requesting State, if, under the legislation of the informing State, the information could, in similar circumstances, be used in the informing State for similar purposes.</p>
      <p n="127">4. Where a competent authority of a Member State considers that information which it has received from the competent authority of another Member State is likely to be useful to the competent authority of a third Member State, it may transmit it to the latter competent authority with the agreement of the competent authority which supplied the information.</p>
      <p n="128">Article 8</p>
      <p n="129">Limits to exchange of information</p>
      <p n="130">1. This Directive shall impose no obligation to have enquiries carried out or to provide information if the Member State, which should furnish the information, would be prevented by its laws or administrative practices from carrying out these enquiries or from collecting or using this information for its own purposes.</p>
      <p n="131">2. The provision of information may be refused where it would lead to the disclosure of a commercial, industrial or professional secret or of a commercial process, or of information whose disclosure would be contrary to public policy.</p>
      <p n="132">3. The competent authority of a Member State may refuse to provide information where the State concerned is unable, for practical or legal reasons, to provide similar information.</p>
      <p n="133">Article 9</p>

      <p n="135">1. For the purposes of the implementation of this Directive, consultations shall be held, if necessary in a Committee, between: - the competent authorities of the Member States concerned at the request of either, in respect of bilateral questions,</p>

      <p n="137">2. The competent authorities of the Member States may communicate directly with each other. The competent authorities of the Member States may by mutual agreement permit authorities designated by them to communicate directly with each other in specified cases or in certain categories of cases.</p>
      <p n="138">3. Where the competent authorities make arrangements on bilateral matters covered by this Directive other than as regards individual cases, they shall as soon as possible inform the Commission thereof. The Commission shall in turn notify the competent authorities of the other Member States.</p>
      <p n="139">Article 10</p>
      <p n="140">Pooling of experience</p>
      <p n="141">The Member States shall, together with the Commission, constantly monitor the cooperation procedure provided for in this Directive and shall pool their experience, especially in the field of transfer pricing within groups of enterprises, with a view to improving such cooperation and, where appropriate, drawing up a body of rules in the fields concerned.</p>
      <p n="142">Article 11</p>
      <p n="143">Applicability of wider-ranging provisions of assistance</p>
      <p n="144">The foregoing provisions shall not impede the fulfilment of any wider obligations to exchange information which might flow from other legal acts.</p>
