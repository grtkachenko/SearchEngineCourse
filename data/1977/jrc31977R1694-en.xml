      <p n="11">2. Paragraph 1 shall apply only if the conditions set out in the first indent of the second subparagraph of Article 9 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 816/70 of 28 April 1970 laying down additional provisions for the common organization of the market in wine (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 528/77 (6), are satisfied.</p>
