      <p n="2">Commission Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 22 February 2001</p>
      <p n="4">amending Annex I to Council Decision 91/666/EEC establishing Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines and updating Decision 2000/112/EC with regard to distribution between antigen banks of antigen reserves</p>

      <p n="6">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="7">(2001/181/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Decision 91/666/EEC of 11 December 1991 establishing Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines(1), as last amended by Decision 1999/762/EC(2), and in particular Articles 7 and 9 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999(4), and in particular Article 14 thereof,</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="13">(1) In conformity with Decision 91/666/EEC, the purchase of antigens is a part of the Community action to establish Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines.</p>
      <p n="14">(2) Annex I to Decision 91/666/EEC details the quantities and subtypes of antigen of the foot-and-mouth disease virus to be stored in Community antigen reserves.</p>
      <p n="15">(3) Forced by the epidemiological situation and following the advice of the World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Pirbright, United Kingdom, and the advice of an expert group established to review certain provisions of Directive 85/511/EEC(5), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, the Community has made purchases of subtypes and quantities of foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens.</p>
      <p n="16">(4) By Commission Decision 93/590/EC of 5 November 1993 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens within the framework of the Community action concerning reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines(6), as last amended by Decision 2000/112/EC(7), arrangements were made for purchase of A5, A22 and O1 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens.</p>
      <p n="17">(5) By Commission Decision 97/348/EC of 23 May 1997 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens and for the formulation, production, bottling and distribution of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease(8), as last amended by Decision 2000/112/EC, arrangements were made for the purchase of A22-Iraq, C1 and ASIA1 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens.</p>
      <p n="18">(6) By Commission Decision 2000/77/EC of 17 December 1999 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens and for the formulation, production, bottling and distribution of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease(9), arrangements were made for purchase of certain quantities of A Iran 96, A Iran 99, A Malaysia 97, SAT 1, SAT 2 (East African and Southern African strains) and SAT 3 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigen.</p>
      <p n="19">(7) By Commission Decision 2000/569/EC of 8 September 2000 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens and for the formulation, production, bottling and distribution of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease(10), arrangements were made for purchase of additional quantities of A22-Iraq, O1-Manisa, ASIA 1-Shamir, A Malaysia 97, SAT 1, SAT 2 (East African and Southern African strains) and SAT 3 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigen.</p>
      <p n="20">(8) It appears necessary to align Annex I to Decision 91/666/EEC to the purchases made by the Community in the light of the epidemiological development.</p>
      <p n="21">(9) It appears also appropriate to update the Annex to Decision 2000/112/EC detailing the distribution between antigen banks of antigen reserves established within the framework of the Community action concerning reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines and amending Decisions 93/590/EC and 97/348/EC.</p>
      <p n="22">(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
      <p n="23">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="24">Article 1</p>
      <p n="25">Annex I to Decision 91/666/EEC is replaced by Annex I to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 2</p>

      <p n="28">Article 3</p>
      <p n="29">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
