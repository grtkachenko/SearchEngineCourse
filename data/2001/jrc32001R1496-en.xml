      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1496/2001 of 20 July 2001 amending Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 and derogating from Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1496/2001</p>
      <p n="3">of 20 July 2001</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 and derogating from Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 47(8) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001(2) introduces a number of derogations to Commission Regulation (EC) No 562/2000(3), in order to deal with the exceptional market situation resulting from the recent events linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The subsequent epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has made certain further amendments necessary.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) It is convenient to introduce the possibility of buying-in carcasses weighing more than the maximum weight while restricting in that case the buying-in price to that of the maximum authorised weight. With regard to the purchase of forequarters, this restriction should be applied by limiting their buying-in price to 40 % of the maximum payable weight for carcasses.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 should therefore be amended.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) In view of the development of events this Regulation must enter into force immediately.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 is replaced by the following: "3. Notwithstanding Article 4(2)(g) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000, for the third quarter of 2001 the maximum weight of the carcasses referred to therein shall be 390 kg; however, carcasses weighing more than 390 kg may be bought into intervention but in that case the buying-in price paid shall not exceed the price for that maximum weight or, in the case of forequarters, the buying-in price paid shall not exceed the price for 40 % of the maximum payable weight."</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="20">Done at Brussels, 20 July 2001.</p>
      <p n="21">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="22">Franz Fischler</p>
      <p n="23">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="24">(1) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 21.</p>
      <p n="25">(2) OJ L 165, 22.6.2001, p. 15.</p>
      <p n="26">(3) OJ L 68, 16.3.2000, p. 22.</p>
