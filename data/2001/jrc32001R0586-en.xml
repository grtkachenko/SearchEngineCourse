      <p n="19">Member States that do not calculate the statistical data covered by Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 to the level of detail of NACE rev. 1 Groups are allowed to calculate national weights for the Groups within a Division in order to do the split-up of the Division-based data into Groups.</p>
      <p n="20">The Member States that apply the allocation to Main Industrial Groupings (MIGS) in part or in total on the basis of NACE rev. 1 Divisions shall inform Eurostat on the weights used for the split-up into NACE rev. 1 Groups.</p>

      <p n="25">Information on conformance to the definitions</p>
