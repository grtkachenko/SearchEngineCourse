      <p n="2">Decision No 1346/2001/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 22 May 2001</p>
      <p n="4">amending Decision No 1692/96/EC as regards seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals as well as project No 8 in Annex III</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 156 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 13 March 2001,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network(5) constitutes a general reference framework covering the objectives, priorities and broad thrust of the measures contemplated as well as the projects of common interest in the area of the trans-European transport network.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Interconnection points including seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals are a pre-condition for the integration of the different transport modes in a multimodal network.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Seaports in the trans-European transport network are classified into categories. These are defined on the basis of quantitative criteria or their location in island, peripheral or outermost regions. Only those ports in the highest category by volume of traffic should be shown, by way of indication, on maps. The specifications which a seaport project is to meet to be deemed of common interest should be set out.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The criteria relating to inland ports should be supplemented by criteria concerning either the nature of their equipment or the volume of traffic and those ports should be shown, by way of indication, on maps.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) The European Council held in Dublin in 1996 decided that project No 8 in the list from the Essen European Council of 1994 should become the Portugal/Spain multimodal link with the rest of Europe.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) Decision No 1692/96/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="18">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="19">Article 1</p>
      <p n="20">Decision No 1692/96/EC is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="21">1. Article 11 shall be amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="22">(a) paragraph 3 shall be replaced by the following: "3. Inland ports shall form part of the network, in particular as points of interconnection between the waterways referred to in paragraph 2 and Article 14 and other modes of transport."</p>
      <p n="23">(b) The following paragraph shall be inserted: "3a. The network shall include inland ports</p>
      <p n="24">(a) open to commercial traffic,</p>
      <p n="25">(b) located on the network of inland waterways as shown in the outline in Annex I, Section 4,</p>
      <p n="26">(c) interconnected with other trans-European transport routes as shown in Annex I, and</p>
      <p n="27">(d) equipped with transhipment facilities for intermodal transport or with an annual freight traffic volume of at least 500000 tonnes."</p>
      <p n="28">2. Article 12 shall be replaced by the following: "Article 12</p>
      <p n="29">Characteristics</p>
      <p n="30">1.

They shall provide equipment and services to transport operators. Their infrastructure shall provide a range of services for passenger and goods transport, including ferry services and short- and long-distance shipping services, including coastal shipping, within the Community and between the latter and non-member countries.</p>
      <p n="31">2. The seaports included in the network shall correspond to one of the categories, A, B or C, defined below:</p>
      <p n="32">A. international seaports: ports with a total annual traffic volume of not less than 1,5 million tonnes of freight or 200000 passengers which, unless it is an impossibility, are connected with the overland elements of the trans-European transport network and therefore play a major role in international maritime transport;</p>
      <p n="33">B. Community seaports, not included in category A: these ports have a total annual traffic volume of not less than 0,5 million tonnes of freight or between 100000 and 199999 passengers, are connected, unless it is an impossibility, with the overland elements of the trans-European transport network and are equipped with the necessary transhipment facilities for short-distance sea shipping;</p>
      <p n="34">C. regional ports: these ports do not meet the criteria of categories A and B but are situated in island, peripheral or outermost regions, interconnecting such regions by sea and/or connecting them with the central regions of the Community.</p>
      <p n="35">The seaports in category A shall be shown on the indicative maps in the outline plans in Section 5 of Annex I, on the basis of the most recent port data.</p>
      <p n="36">3. In addition to the criteria set out in Article 7, seaport projects of common interest related to seaports included in the trans-European seaport network shall comply with the criteria and specifications in Annex II."</p>
      <p n="37">3. Article 14 shall be replaced by the following: "Article 14</p>
      <p n="38">Characteristics</p>

      <p n="40">- railways and inland waterways which are suitable for combined transport and shipping which, combined where appropriate with the shortest possible initial and/or terminal road haulage, permit the long-distance transport of goods,</p>
      <p n="41">- intermodal terminals equipped with installations permitting transhipment between railways, inland waterways, shipping routes and roads,</p>
      <p n="42">- suitable rolling stock, on a provisional basis, where the characteristics of the infrastructure, as yet unadapted, so require."</p>
      <p n="43">4. Article 19 shall be replaced by the following: "Article 19</p>
      <p n="44">Specific projects</p>
