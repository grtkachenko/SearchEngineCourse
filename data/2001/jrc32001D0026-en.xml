      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 64/432/EEC on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine(1), as last amended by Directive 2000/20/EC(2), and in particular Annex AI(4) thereto,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Commission Decision 1999/467/EC of 15 July 1999 establishing the officially tuberculosis-free status of bovine herds of certain Member States or regions of Member States and repealing Decision 97/76/EC(3), as last amended by Decision 2000/694/EC(4), granted this status to certain Member States and regions thereof.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) The competent authorities of France submitted to the Commission documentation demonstrating compliance with all of the conditions provided for in Annex A(I)(4) to Directive 64/432/EEC, and in particular that, calculated at 31 December of each year, more than 99,9 % of the bovine herds in France have been officially free from bovine tuberculosis for the past six consecutive years and that recording in a database established in December 1999 allows tracing of bovine animals which are identified in accordance with Community legislation.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) It appears therefore appropriate to declare France officially tuberculosis-free in accordance with the provisions of the above Directive.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
