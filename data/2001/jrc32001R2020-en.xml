      <p n="16">The version valid as of 1 January 2002 of the nomenclature of countries and territories for the external trade statistics of the Community and statistics of trade between Member States is set out in the Annex hereto.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2002.</p>
      <p n="19">However, the Member States may use the three-digit numeric codes also shown in the Annex to this Regulation until the provisions revising Annexes 37 and 38 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(4) come into force.</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
