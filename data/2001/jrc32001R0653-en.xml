      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 states that compensatory payments may be made in cases where the exchange rate applicable on the date of the operative event is below that previously applicable. However, that provision is not applicable to amounts to which a rate lower than the new rate was applicable during the 24 months immediately before the new rate took effect.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The exchange rate for the pound sterling applicable on the operative event dates of 31 December 2000 and 1 January 2001 was lower than those previously applicable.</p>

      <p n="12">(4) The amounts of the compensatory aid are established in accordance with Articles 5 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 and with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 2808/98.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of the Management Committees concerned,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">The maximum amounts of the first tranche of compensatory aid which the United Kingdom may pay as a result of the reduction recorded on the operative event dates of 31 December 2000 and 1 January 2001 in the exchange rate for the pound sterling compared to the rate previously applicable are listed in the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="20">Done at Brussels, 30 March 2001.</p>
