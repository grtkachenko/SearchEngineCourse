      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Decision 96/317/EC of 13 May 1996 concerning the conclusion of the results of the consultations with Thailand under GATT Article XXIII(2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,</p>

      <p n="11">(2) Thailand has amended its export certificates and Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 327/98 should therefore be replaced.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Experience of the management of the quotas has shown the advantage of including the export certificate number in Member States' notifications to the Commission. Regulation (EC) No 327/98 should therefore be amended and Annex III thereto should be replaced.</p>

The first indent of Article 8 is replaced by the following: "- within two working days of their issue, of the quantities, broken down by eight-figure CN code and country of origin, covered by the import licences issued, with details of the date of issue, the export certificate number, the licence number and the name and address of the holder,"</p>
      <p n="18">2. Annexes I and III are replaced by Annexes I and II hereto.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2002.</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
