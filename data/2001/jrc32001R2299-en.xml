      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001</p>
      <p n="3">of 26 November 2001</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products, and Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 9(2) and Article 13(11) thereof, and to the corresponding provisions of the other regulations on the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2298/2001 of 26 November 2001 laying down detailed rules for the export of products supplied as food aid(3), stipulates that an export licence with advance fixing of the refund must be presented for exports in the context of food-aid operations for which a refund is sought. The relevant provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 90/2001(5), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2001(7), should therefore be amended.</p>

The reference made in Article 24(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 to the licences for these operations does not therefore apply and must be deleted as a result.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of all the Management Committees concerned,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="15">However, no licence shall be required to obtain a refund:</p>
      <p n="16">- where the quantities exported per export declaration are less than or equal to the quantities set out in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000,</p>
      <p n="17">- in cases covered by Articles 6, 36, 40, 44, 45 and Article 46(1),</p>
      <p n="18">- for deliveries to Member States' armed forces stationed in non-member countries."</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 is amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="21">1. Article 16 is replaced by the following text: "Article 16</p>

      <p n="35">2. Article 24(1)(b) is replaced by the following: "(b) in the case of an export licence or certificate of advance fixing of the refund, the declaration relating to:</p>
      <p n="36">- export, or</p>
      <p n="37">- the placing of products under one of the arrangements provided for in Articles 4 and 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 565/80."</p>
      <p n="38">Article 3</p>
