      <p n="6">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="7">(2001/689/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(1), and in particular Articles 3, 4 and 6 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that the eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria shall be established according to product groups.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that the review of the eco-label criteria as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to the criteria shall take place in due time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for each product group and shall result in a proposal for prolongation, withdrawal or revision.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) By Decision 98/483/EC(2), the Commission established ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to dishwashers, which, according to Article 3 thereof, as amended by Decision 2001/397/EC(3), expire on 31 January 2003.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) It is appropriate to revise the definition of the product group and the ecological criteria that were established by Decision 98/483/EC in order to reflect the developments in the market.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) It is appropriate to adopt a new Commission Decision establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of five years.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than 12 months, both the new criteria established by this Decision and the criteria previously established by Decision 98/483/EC, are valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies that have been awarded the eco-label for their products prior to the adoption of this new Decision to adapt these products to comply with the new criteria.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) The measures set out in this Decision have been developed and adopted under the procedures for the setting of eco-label criteria as laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,</p>
      <p n="20">(9) The measures set out in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee set up under Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,</p>

      <p n="34">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="35">Margot Wallström</p>
      <p n="36">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="37">(1) OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="38">(2) OJ L 216, 4.8.1998, p. 12.</p>
      <p n="39">(3) OJ L 139, 23.5.2001, p. 21.</p>
      <p n="40">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="41">FRAMEWORK</p>
      <p n="42">In order to qualify for the eco-label, a dishwasher (hereinafter referred to as "the product") must fall within the product group as defined in Article 1, and must comply with the criteria of this Annex, with tests carried out on application as indicated in the criteria. Where appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body assessing the application. Where no tests are mentioned, or are mentioned as being for use in verification or monitoring, competent bodies should rely as appropriate on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications.</p>
      <p n="43">The competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex (Note: it is not required to implement such management schemes.)</p>
      <p n="44">These criteria aim in particular at promoting:</p>
      <p n="45">- reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of energy (global warming, acidification, depletion of non-renewable resources) by reducing energy consumption,</p>
      <p n="46">- reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by reducing water consumption.</p>
      <p n="47">The criteria encourage the implementation of best practice (optimal environmental use) and enhance consumers' environmental awareness. Furthermore, marking the plastic components encourages the recycling of the machine.</p>
      <p n="48">The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of dishwashers that have a lower environmental impact, in particular during their use.</p>
      <p n="49">ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA</p>
