      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(1), and in particular Article 4(8), Article 6(2) and Article 7(5) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>

The amounts thus retained from the aid payments must be credited to a specific account opened for each paying agency or on a specific unique account opened at the level of the Member State and intended exclusively for the financing of the additional Community support. This account should also be part of the annual accounts within the meaning of Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The guidelines for criteria for accreditation as a paying agency in respect of the processing of claims by means of a computer system should be updated in the light of developments in computer processing.</p>
