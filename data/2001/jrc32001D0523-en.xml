      <p n="36">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="37">FRAMEWORK</p>
      <p n="38">In order to qualify for the eco-label, an all purpose cleaner or a cleaner for sanitary facilities (hereinafter referred to as "the product") must fall within the product group as defined in Article 1, and must comply with the criteria of this Annex, with tests carried out on application as indicated in the criteria and the technical appendix. Where appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the Competent Body or Bodies assessing the application (hereinafter referred to as the "Competent Body"). Competent Bodies should recognise tests and verification performed by bodies which are accredited under the standards of EN 45 000 series or equivalent international standards. Where no tests are mentioned, or are mentioned as being for use in verification or monitoring, Competent Bodies should rely as appropriate on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications. Where it is indicated that specific documentation and/or declarations are required, these shall be provided by the applicant and/or the manufacturers) and/or the suppliers) as appropriate. Where ingredients are referred to, this includes substances and preparations.</p>
      <p n="39">The Competent Bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex (Note: it is not required to implement such management schemes.)</p>
      <p n="40">These criteria aim at promoting:</p>
      <p n="41">- the reduction of environmental impact by limiting the quantity of harmful ingredients, by reducing the quantity of detergent used and by reducing packaging waste,</p>
      <p n="42">- the reduction or prevention of risks for the environment and for human health related to the use of hazardous substances,</p>
      <p n="43">- information that will enable the consumer to use the product in the way that is efficient and minimises environmental impact.</p>
      <p n="44">The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of all-purpose cleaners and sanitary cleaners that have a low environmental impact.</p>
      <p n="45">FUNCTIONAL UNIT</p>
      <p n="46">For all purpose cleaners the functional unit (used in the criteria below) is the dosage in grams of the product recommended by the manufacturer for 1 litre of suds (washing water).</p>
      <p n="47">For cleaners for sanitary facilities, no functional unit is defined (the relevant criteria below being calculated in relation to 100 g of the product).</p>
      <p n="48">ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA</p>
      <p n="49">1. Eco-toxicity and biodegradability</p>
      <p n="50">The critical dilution volume toxicity (CDVtox) is calculated for each ingredient (i) using the following equation:</p>
      <p n="51">&gt;PIC FILE= "L_2001189EN.002602.TIF"&gt;</p>
      <p n="52">where weight (i) is the weight of the ingredient per functional unit (for all purpose cleaners) or per 100 g of product (cleaners for sanitary facilities), LF is the loading factor and LTE is the long-term toxicity effect concentration of the ingredient. The values of the LF and LTE parameters shall be as given in the detergent ingredient database list (DID list) in point A of the appendix. If the ingredient in question is not included in the DID list, the applicant shall estimate the values following the approach described in point B of the appendix. The CDVtox is summed for each ingredient, making the CDVtox for the product.</p>
      <p n="53">For all-purpose cleaners, the CDVtox for the product shall not exceed 400 l/functional unit.</p>

      <p n="176">For ingredients which are not included in the DID-list, the applicant shall, under his own responsibility, find the appropriate values for the relevant parameters. The reference for the relevant test methods shall be the appropriate annexes of Council Directive 67/548/EC(1).</p>

      <p n="178">1. HOW TO ESTIMATE LONG-TERM-TOXICITY-EFFECT CONCENTRATION (LTE)</p>
      <p n="179">As LTE the lowest validated long-term toxicity concentration for fish, daphnia magna or algae shall be considered.</p>
      <p n="180">In cases where data on homologues and/or QSARs (quantitative structure activity relationships) are used, a correction could be considered for the finally selected LTE. If long-term toxicity data (such as NOEC) for one or more of the three species are missing, or only short-term toxicity data (such as LC50) are available, the following uncertainty factors (UF) shall be used:</p>
      <p n="181">1.1. Uncertainty factors (UF) for non-surfactants</p>
      <p n="182">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="183">Deviation from this rule may be admitted if evidence can be provided that lower factors or data can be justified scientifically.</p>

      <p n="185">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="186">2. HOW TO ESTIMATE LOADING FACTORS (LF)</p>
      <p n="187">The loading factors (LF) for calculating the critical dilution volume toxicity (CDVtox) reflect the percentage of the substance which passes the sewage treatment system and depends on bio-degradability and sorption tendency of the substance.</p>

      <p n="189">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="190">Note:</p>
      <p n="191">Sorption can be estimated by log Pow (partition coefficient octanol/water), where Pow &lt; 2 is considered as "low sorption", Pow &lt; x &lt; 4 is "medium sorption" and Pow &gt; 4 is "high sorption". Where no sorption data are available, low sorption is assumed.</p>
