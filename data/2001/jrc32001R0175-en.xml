      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 175/2001</p>
      <p n="3">of 26 January 2001</p>
      <p n="4">laying down the marketing standard for walnuts in shell</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Article 2(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Walnuts are among the products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 for which standards must be adopted. To that end and in the interests of preserving transparency on the world market, account should be taken of the standard for walnuts in shell recommended by the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Applying this standard should result in products of unsatisfactory quality being removed from the market, bringing production into line with consumer requirements and facilitating trade relationships based on fair competition, thereby helping to improve the profitability of production. Therefore it applies at all marketing stages.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">The marketing standard for walnuts in shell falling within CN code 0802 31 00 shall be as set out in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="15">The standard shall apply at all stages of marketing, under the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 2</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="18">It shall apply from 1 September 2001.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="20">Done at Brussels, 26 January 2001.</p>
      <p n="21">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="22">Franz Fischler</p>
      <p n="23">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="24">(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="25">(2) OJ L 328, 23.12.2000, p. 2.</p>
      <p n="26">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="27">STANDARD FOR WALNUTS IN SHELL</p>
      <p n="28">I. DEFINITION OF PRODUCE</p>
      <p n="29">This standard applies to walnuts in shell free from outer husks, from varieties (cultivars) grown from Juglans regia L., to be supplied to the consumer, walnuts for industrial processing being excluded.</p>
      <p n="30">The expression "fresh walnuts" or "early walnuts" means walnuts which have been marketed soon after harvesting and cannot be preserved for a long time, from which the husk has been removed and which have not been treated in any way that tends to change their natural moisture content.</p>
      <p n="31">The expression "dry walnuts" means walnuts which can be preserved for a long time under normal conditions of storage(1).</p>
      <p n="32">II. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY</p>
      <p n="33">The purpose of the standard is to define the quality requirements of walnuts in shell, after preparation and packaging.</p>
      <p n="34">A. Minimum requirements(2)</p>
      <p n="35">(i) In all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the walnuts in shell must be:</p>
      <p n="36">(a) Characteristics of the shell:</p>
      <p n="37">- intact; slight superficial damage is not considered as a defect; partially open walnuts are considered to be intact provided that the kernel is physically protected,</p>
      <p n="38">- sound; free from defects likely to affect the natural keeping quality of the fruits,</p>
      <p n="39">- free of damage caused by pests,</p>
      <p n="40">- clean; practically free of any visible foreign matter,</p>
      <p n="41">- dry; free from abnormal external moisture,</p>
      <p n="42">- free from residues of husk.</p>
      <p n="43">The shells of dry walnuts must show no trace of hulling.</p>
      <p n="44">(b) Characteristics of the kernels:</p>
      <p n="45">- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,</p>
      <p n="46">- firm,</p>
      <p n="47">- clean, practically free of any visible foreign matter,</p>
      <p n="48">- free from insects or mites whatever their stage of development,</p>
      <p n="49">- free of damage caused by pests,</p>
      <p n="50">- free from rancidity and/or oily appearance,</p>
      <p n="51">- free from mould,</p>
      <p n="52">- free of abnormal external moisture;</p>
      <p n="53">- free of foreign smell and/or taste,</p>
      <p n="54">- normally developed, shrivelled kernels are to be excluded.</p>
      <p n="55">(c) The walnuts in shell must be gathered when sufficiently mature.</p>
      <p n="56">Walnuts must not be empty.</p>
      <p n="57">In the case of "fresh walnuts", it must be possible to peel off the skin of the kernel easily and the internal central partition must show signs of turning brown.</p>
      <p n="58">In the case of "dry walnuts", the internal central partition must be dry and brittle.</p>
      <p n="59">Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2 of European Parliament and Council Directive 95/2/EC(3), as last amended by Directive 98/72/EC(4), the shells may be washed and bleached provided that the treatment applied does not affect the quality of the kernels.</p>
      <p n="60">The condition of the walnuts in shell should be such as to enable them:</p>
      <p n="61">- to withstand normal transport and handling, and</p>
      <p n="62">- to arrive in a satisfactory condition at the place of destination.</p>
      <p n="63">(ii) Moisture content</p>
      <p n="64">Dry walnuts shall have a moisture content not greater than 12 % for the whole nut and 8 % for the kernel(5).</p>
      <p n="65">The natural moisture content of whole fresh walnuts shall be equal to or greater than 20 %.</p>
      <p n="66">B. Classification</p>
      <p n="67">Walnuts in shell are classified in three classes defined below.</p>
      <p n="68">(i) "Extra" class</p>
      <p n="69">Walnuts in shell in this class must be of superior quality. They must have the characteristics of the variety or of the mixture of certain varieties officially defined by the producing country and specified in the marking.</p>
      <p n="70">They must be practically free from defects with the exception of very slight superficial defects provided these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation in the package.</p>
      <p n="71">This class may not include walnuts in shell whose variety cannot be guaranteed, nor a mixture which is not defined.</p>
      <p n="72">Furthermore, only walnuts of the most recent harvest can be included in this class.</p>
      <p n="73">(ii) Class I</p>
      <p n="74">Walnuts in shell in this class must be of good quality. They must be characteristic of the variety, of a commercial type or of a mixture of certain varieties officially defined by the producing country and specified in the marking.</p>
      <p n="75">Slight defects may be allowed provided these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation in the package.</p>
      <p n="76">This class may not include walnuts in shell whose variety cannot be guaranteed, nor a mixture which is not defined.</p>
      <p n="77">(iii) Class II</p>
      <p n="78">This class includes walnuts in shell which do not qualify for inclusion in the higher classes, but satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.</p>
      <p n="79">Defects may be allowed provided the walnuts in shell retain their essential characteristics as regards the quality, keeping quality and presentation.</p>
      <p n="80">III. PROVISIONS CONCERNING SIZING</p>
      <p n="81">Size is determined either by an interval determined by the minimum diameter and the maximum diameter (sizing) or by an indication of the minimum diameter followed by "and above" or "and +" (screening).</p>
      <p n="82">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="83">IV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERANCES</p>
      <p n="84">Tolerances in respect of quality and size shall be allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements of the class indicated.</p>
      <p n="85">A. Quality tolerances</p>
      <p n="86">In the calculation of tolerances, whatever the class, two half empty walnuts or four quarter-empty walnuts are counted as one empty walnut.</p>
      <p n="87">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="88">B. Mineral impurities</p>
      <p n="89">Ashes insoluble in acid must not exceed 1 g/kg.</p>
      <p n="90">C. Size tolerances</p>
      <p n="91">For all classes, a maximum of 10 %, by number or weight, of walnuts in shell not conforming to the size indicated in the marking is tolerated within the limits such that:</p>
      <p n="92">- the nuts correspond to the sizes immediately below or above when the size is designated by an interval determined by the minimum diameter and the maximum diameter (sizing),</p>
      <p n="93">- the nuts correspond to the size immediately below when the size is designated by an indication of the minimum diameter followed by "and above" or "and +" (screening).</p>
      <p n="94">V. PROVISIONS CONCERNING PRESENTATION</p>
      <p n="95">A. Uniformity</p>
      <p n="96">The contents of each package must be uniform and contain only walnuts in shell of the same origin, crop year, quality and size (if sized). In a single package stated to contain a given variety, a defined mixture of varieties or commercial type, a maximum of 10 %, by number or weight, of walnuts in shell may belong to other varieties or commercial types.</p>
      <p n="97">The visible part of the contents of the package must be representative of the entire contents.</p>
      <p n="98">B. Packaging</p>
      <p n="99">Walnuts in shell must be packed in such a way as to protect the produce properly.</p>
      <p n="100">The materials used inside the package must be new, clean and of a quality such as to avoid causing any external or internal damage to the produce. The use of materials, particularly of paper or stamps bearing trade specifications, is allowed provided the printing or labelling has been done with non-toxic ink or glue.</p>
