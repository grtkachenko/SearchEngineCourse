      <p n="3">of 16 January 2001</p>
      <p n="4">laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards notifications concerning recognition of producer organisations, the fixing of prices and intervention within the scope of the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products(1), and in particular Article 34(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) In accordance with Article 13(6) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the Commission publishes annually a list of recognised producer organisations and associations thereof. Member States must therefore provide it with adequate information.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The Commission has to be able to monitor the price stabilisation activities of the producer organisations and the way in which they apply the systems of financial compensation and carry-over premiums.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The Community intervention arrangements pursuant to Articles 21 to 26 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 require information to be available on the prices recorded in clearly defined regions at regular intervals.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) A system of electronic transmission of data between the Member States and the Commission has been introduced within the framework of management of the common fisheries policy (FIDES II system). It should be used for the purposes of collecting the information referred to in this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The data formerly collected under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2210/93 of 26 July 1993 on the communication of information for the purposes of the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 843/95(3), should therefore be simplified, harmonised and supplemented. A new Regulation should therefore be drawn up and Regulation (EEC) No 2210/93 should be repealed.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,</p>
