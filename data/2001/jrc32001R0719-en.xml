      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 590/2001 derogating from and amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 47(8) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 590/2001(2) introduces a number of amendments and derogations to Commission Regulation (EC) No 562/2000(3) in order to deal with the exceptional market situation resulting from the recent events linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).</p>
      <p n="10">(2) In view of that situation and to improve the effectiveness of the intervention measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 590/2001 a derogation should be granted from Article 4(2)(g) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 relating to the two April tendering procedures by allowing the purchase of heavier animals while restricting their buying-in price to that of the maximum authorised weight.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Regulation (EC) No 590/2001 should therefore be amended.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) In view of the development of events this Regulation must enter into force immediately.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 590/2001 is replaced by the following: "3. Notwithstanding Article 4(2)(g) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000, for the second quarter of 2001 the maximum weight of the carcasses referred to therein shall be:</p>
      <p n="17">- 430 kg for the first two tendering procedures; however, carcasses weighing more than 430 kg may be bought into intervention but in that case the buying- in price paid shall not exceed the price for that maximum weight,</p>
      <p n="18">- 410 kg for the third and fourth tendering procedures,</p>
      <p n="19">- 390 kg for the last two tendering procedures."</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 10 April 2001.</p>
