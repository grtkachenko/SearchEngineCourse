      <p n="3">of 28 May 2001</p>
      <p n="4">on the adaptation of Parts V and VI and Annex 13 of the Common Consular Instructions on Visas and Annex 6a to the Common Manual with regard to long-stay visas valid concurrently as short-stay visas</p>
      <p n="5">(2001/420/EC)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 of 24 April 2001 reserving to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for examining visa applications(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 790/2001 of 24 April 2001 reserving to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for carrying out border checks and surveillance(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the initiative of the French Republic,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) It is necessary to adapt the Common Consular Instructions on Visas and the Common Manual in order to facilitate the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1091/2001 of 28 May 2001 on freedom of movement with a long-stay visa(3).</p>
      <p n="12">(2) This Decision builds on the Schengen acquis, in accordance with the Protocol integrating it into the framework of the European Union, as laid down by Annex A to Council Decision 1999/435/EC of 20 May 1999 concerning the definition of the Schengen acquis for the purpose of determining, in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty on European Union, the legal basis for each of the provisions or decisions which constitute the acquis(4).</p>
      <p n="13">(3) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not participating in the adoption of this instrument, and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Decision aims to build upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Decision whether it will transpose it into its national law.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded on 18 May 1999 by the Council of the European Union and those two States(5).</p>
      <p n="15">(5) Pursuant to Article 1 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland and the United Kingdom are not participating in the adoption of this Decision.
