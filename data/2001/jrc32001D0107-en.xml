      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) There are no detailed technical specifications and adequate references to the relevant European standards have not been added to the Annexes to Council Directive 94/55/EC of 21 November 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road(2), as last amended by Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council 2000/61/EC(3), and to Council Directive 96/49/EC of 23 July 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail(4), as last amended by Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council 2000/62/EC(5), for the pressure drums, cylinder racks and tanks referred to in Article 2 of Directive 1999/36/EC.

      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">Pursuant to Article 17(2) of Directive 1999/36/EC, the date of implementation of the said Directive is hereby deferred to 1 July 2003 for pressure drums, cylinder racks and tanks.</p>
