      <p n="4">on establishing ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to portable computers</p>
      <p n="5">(notified under document number C(2001) 2596)</p>
      <p n="6">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="7">(2001/687/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(1), and in particular Articles 3, 4 and 6 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that the eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria shall be established according to product groups.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that the review of the eco-label criteria as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to the criteria shall take place in due time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for each product group and shall result in a proposal for prolongation, withdrawal or revision.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) By Decision 1999/698/EC(2), the Commission established ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to portable computers, which, according to Article 3 thereof, expire on 31 October 2001.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) It is appropriate to revise the definition of the product group and the ecological criteria that were established by Decision 1999/698/EC in order to reflect the developments in the market.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) It is appropriate to adopt a new Commission Decision establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of three years.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than 12 months, both the new criteria established by this Decision and the criteria previously established by Decision 1999/698/EC, are valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies that have been awarded the eco-label for their products prior to the adoption of this new Decision to adapt these products to comply with the new criteria.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) The measures set out in this Decision have been developed and adopted under the procedures for the setting of eco-label criteria as laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.</p>
      <p n="20">(9) The measures set out in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee set up under Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,</p>
      <p n="21">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="22">Article 1</p>
      <p n="23">The product group "portable computers" (hereinafter referred to as "the product group") shall mean: "A computer which can be used in multiple locations, and which consists of a system unit, display and keyboard combined in a single case, which is intended to be easily transported between locations and can be used with an internal battery.".</p>
      <p n="24">Article 2</p>
      <p n="25">The environmental performance of the product group as defined in Article 1 shall be assessed by reference to the specific ecological criteria set out in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 3</p>
      <p n="27">The product group definition and the criteria for the product group shall be valid for three years from the date on which this Decision takes effect. If revised criteria have not been adopted before the end of this period, their validity shall be extended for a further year.</p>
      <p n="28">The period of validity of the product group definition and the criteria established by Decision 1999/698/EC shall be extended to expire 12 months after the date on which this Decision takes effect.</p>
      <p n="29">Article 4</p>
      <p n="30">For administrative purposes the code number assigned to the product group shall be "018".</p>
      <p n="31">Article 5</p>
      <p n="32">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="33">Done at Brussels, 28 August 2001.</p>
      <p n="34">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="35">Margot Wallstr√∂m</p>
      <p n="36">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="37">(1) OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="38">(2) OJ L 276, 27.10.1999, p. 7.</p>
      <p n="39">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="40">FRAMEWORK</p>
      <p n="41">In order to qualify for the eco-label, a portable computer (hereinafter referred to as "the product") must fall within the product group as defined in Article 1, and must comply with the criteria of this Annex, with tests carried out on application as indicated in the criteria. Testing shall be performed by laboratories that meet the general requirements expressed in standard EN ISO 17025. Where appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body assessing the application. Where no tests are mentioned, or are mentioned as being for use in verification or monitoring, competent bodies should rely as appropriate on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications.</p>
      <p n="42">These criteria aim in particular at promoting:</p>
      <p n="43">- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of energy (global warming, acidification, depletion of non-renewable resources) by reducing energy consumption,</p>
      <p n="44">- the reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by encouraging the exchangeability of components, and the recyclability and maintainability of the product,</p>
      <p n="45">- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of hazardous substances by reducing the use of such substances.</p>
      <p n="46">The criteria encourage the implementation of best practice (optimal environmental use) and enhance consumers' environmental awareness. Furthermore, the marking of plastic components encourages the recycling of the product.</p>
      <p n="47">The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of portable computers that have a lower environmental impact.</p>
