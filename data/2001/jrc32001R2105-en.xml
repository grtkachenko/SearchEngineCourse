      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2105/2001 of 26 October 2001 amending Regulation (EC) No 1093/2001 as regards hemp imports</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2105/2001</p>
      <p n="3">of 26 October 2001</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 1093/2001 as regards hemp imports</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 of 27 July 2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre(1), and in particular Articles 9 and 14 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) New rules relating to hemp imports are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1093/2001(2), amending Regulation (EC) No 245/2001(3) laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000. Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1093/2001 stipulates that those rules must apply from 1 November 2001.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The creation of national measures corresponding to the new rules on hemp imports requires major national legislative, administrative and practical changes. As a result, some Member States may not be able to guarantee application of the new rules on the envisaged date, 1 November 2001. The Member States should be granted sufficient extra time to ensure that the rules enter into force at the same time and in the same way, so a new date of 1 May 2002 should be set for application of the new rules. As a consequence, the control measures in force prior to the former date must continue in application until 30 April 2002.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Natural Fibres,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">In Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1093/2001, the date "1 November 2001" is replaced by "1 May 2002" and the date "31 October 2001" is replaced by "30 April 2002".</p>
      <p n="15">Article 2</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="18">Done at Brussels, 26 October 2001.</p>
      <p n="19">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="20">Franz Fischler</p>
      <p n="21">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="22">(1) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 16.</p>
      <p n="23">(2) OJ L 150, 6.6.2001, p. 17.</p>
      <p n="24">(3) OJ L 35, 6.2.2001, p. 18.</p>
