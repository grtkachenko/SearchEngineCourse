      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1851/2001</p>
      <p n="3">of 20 September 2001</p>
      <p n="4">correcting Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice-cream and other foodstuffs</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1670/2000(2), and in particular Article 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Annex VII to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 635/2000(4), lists the specifications to be entered in the T5 control copy. A check of all language versions has discovered a typing error in that Annex.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Article 22(4) of that Regulation provides for a penalty for failure to comply with a subordinate obligation and Annex III thereto indicates the tracers to be used for Formula B. Typing and translation errors were found during a check of the German version of those provisions.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The necessary corrections must therefore be made to that language version.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="15">1. The term "Butter" in the second paragraph of the third indent of the first indent of Annex VII.B(b) to Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 is replaced by the term "Butterfett".</p>
      <p n="16">2. Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 and Annex III thereto are corrected. These corrections concern only the German version of the Regulation.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="20">Done at Brussels, 20 September 2001.</p>
