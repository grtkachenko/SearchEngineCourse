      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 15 and 34 thereof,</p>

      <p n="9">(1) At its extraordinary meeting on 21 September 2001, the European Council declared that terrorism is a real challenge to the world and to Europe and that the fight against terrorism will be a priority objective of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) On 28 September 2001, the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1373(2001), reaffirming that terrorist acts constitute a threat to peace and security and setting out measures aimed at combating terrorism and in particular the fight against the financing of terrorism and the provision of safe havens for terrorists.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) On 8 October 2001, the Council reaffirmed the determination of the EU and its Member States to play their full part, in a coordinated manner, in the global coalition against terrorism, under the aegis of the United Nations. The Council also reiterated the Union's determination to attack the sources which fund terrorism, in close cooperation with the United States.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) On 19 October 2001, the European Council declared that it is determined to combat terrorism in every form throughout the world and that it will continue its efforts to strengthen the coalition of the international community to combat terrorism in every shape and form, for example by the increased cooperation between the operational services responsible for combating terrorism: Europol, Eurojust, the intelligence services, police forces and judicial authorities.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) Action has already been taken to implement some of the measures listed below.</p>
