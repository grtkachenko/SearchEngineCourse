      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001 of 17 December 2001 aiming to promote the conversion of fishing vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco</head>
      <p n="2">Council Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001</p>
      <p n="3">of 17 December 2001</p>
      <p n="4">aiming to promote the conversion of fishing vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 36 and 37 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) The Agreement on the relations as regards sea fishing between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco (hereinafter referred to as "the fisheries agreement with Morocco"), became null and void on 30 November 1999. Consequently, a significant number of Community vessels that operated within this framework were forced to stop their fishing activities at that date.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) The fishermen and owners of the vessels concerned benefited in this connection from the allowances provided for in Article 16(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999(4) with the assistance of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), under the derogation conditions laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1227/2001(5).</p>
      <p n="13">(3) It is justified to encourage, by appropriate measures at the Community level, the implementation of the conversion plans of the fleets concerned as approved by the Commission on 18 October 2000.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) It is necessary to facilitate the permanent cessation activity of the vessels, whether by demolition or by transfer to a third country, including within the framework of joint enterprises. It is also appropriate to facilitate the replacement of fishing gear for the permanent conversion towards other fishing activities, whatever the age of the vessel and even if it were the subject of public aid for construction.</p>
      <p n="15">(5) Consequently, there is a need for derogations from certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999.</p>
      <p n="16">(6) Moreover, in the spirit of the conclusions of the European Council of Nice, the European Union should signal its solidarity with the Member States concerned, by means of an additional financial effort, over and above the amounts made available inside heading 2 of the financial perspectives for the budget of the European Union, as fixed at the European Council of Berlin on 25 March 1999.</p>
      <p n="17">(7) Consequently, a specific measure of the Community should be instituted to execute the appropriations in question in order to implement part of the conversion plans, on the understanding that the other parts of the aforementioned plans will have to be carried out with the assistance of FIFG appropriations.</p>
      <p n="18">(8) The complementary appropriations available should be devoted to the specific measure, on the one hand to the restructuring of the fleet, and on the other hand to the fishermen's early retirement or retraining, away from sea fishing, under individual or collective social plans.</p>
      <p n="19">(9) The specific measure must be consistent with the general principles of the structural policy in the fisheries sector. In particular, distortions must be avoided with the provisions in force for the implementation of the FIFG appropriations. An operational mechanism of management must also be envisaged as close as possible to that in force for the Community Structural Funds, as fixed by Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999(6).</p>
      <p n="20">(10) The vessels due to operate in international waters or in waters of third countries must fully respect international law with regard to the conservation of fishing resources and in particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of Seas as well as the Code of Conduct of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.</p>
      <p n="21">(11) The socio-economic diversification of the coastal areas dependent on fishing naturally fits into the context of the integrated operational regional development programmes and multi-regional programmes arising from the Community support frameworks of the Objective 1 of the Structural Funds for Spain and for Portugal, with the financial assistance of the European Regional Development Fund, of the European Social Fund and of the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guidance Section. Under these conditions, it is not justified to envisage a specific intervention devoted to this diversification,</p>
      <p n="22">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="23">CHAPTER I</p>
      <p n="24">GENERAL</p>
      <p n="25">Article 1</p>
      <p n="26">1. The fishermen and the vessel owners to whom, during 2000 and 2001, compensation was granted under Article 16(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999, owing to the non-renewal of the fishing agreement with Morocco, for at least a six-month cumulative period of temporary cessation of activity, can benefit from exceptional supporting measures, under the conditions and within the limits envisaged by this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="27">2. At the latest three months after the entry into force of this Regulation, Member States shall communicate to the Commission the list of vessels, indicating their internal numbers, as well as the list of names of the fishermen meeting the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of the Regulation.</p>
      <p n="28">CHAPTER II</p>
      <p n="29">DEROGATION MEASURES</p>
      <p n="30">Article 2</p>
      <p n="31">1. By derogation from the provisions referred to below of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999, public aid to the owners of the vessels and the fishermen referred to in Article 1(1) shall be granted according to the following rules:</p>
      <p n="32">(a) where public aid is granted for the demolition of a vessel:</p>
      <p n="33">(i) the scales referred to in Article 7(5)(a) shall be increased by 20 %;</p>
      <p n="34">(ii) the provisions of Article 10(3)(b)(ii) and those of Annex III, point 1.1(a) shall not be applicable;</p>
      <p n="35">(b) where a premium is granted for the permanent transfer of a vessel to a third country, including in the case of a joint enterprise:</p>
      <p n="36">(i) the scales referred to in Article 7(5)(a) shall be increased by 20 %;</p>
      <p n="37">(ii) the provisions of Article 10(3)(b)(ii) as well as those of Annex III, point 1.1(a), shall not be applicable;</p>
      <p n="38">(iii) the minimum age of the vessels referred to in Article 7(2) shall be reduced to five years; for 5 to 9-year-old vessels, however, the reference premium, as referred to in Article 7(5)(a), shall be that applicable to vessels of 10 to 15 years old. This premium shall be reduced by part of the amount previously received in cases of aid granted for construction and/or modernisation; this part shall be calculated pro rata temporis of the 10-year period (in the case of aid for construction) or 5-year period (in the case of aid for modernisation) preceding the permanent transfer;</p>
      <p n="39">(c) in the event of permanent conversion of a vessel to another fishing activity requiring the change of fishing technique, the replacement of the fishing gear may be the subject of public aid as a modernisation of the vessel, under the following derogation conditions:</p>
      <p n="40">(i) the last subparagraph of Annex III, point 1.4, shall not be applicable;</p>
      <p n="41">(ii) the scales referred to in Article 9(4)(b) shall be increased by 30 %;</p>
      <p n="42">(iii) the provisions of Article 10(3)(a) shall not be applicable;</p>
      <p n="43">(d) in the case of an individual lump sum payment to a fisherman, the maximum eligible cost referred to in Article 12(3)(b) and (c) shall be increased by 20 %.</p>
      <p n="44">2. The derogation rules mentioned in paragraph 1 shall apply only to premiums and public aid that have been granted under an administrative decision by the Authorities referred to in Article 6, taken between 1 July 2001 and 30 June 2003.</p>
      <p n="45">3. The vessel owners shall no longer be eligible for the compensation for temporary cessation of activity mentioned in Article 1 as from the date of the administrative decision granting a premium for the permanent cessation of activity or a public aid for the modernisation of the vessel concerned, which has been taken pursuant to the modalities provided for in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p n="46">In the case of advance payment of this compensation, any amount overpaid will be deducted from the premium for permanent cessation or from the public aid for modernisation, granted for the boat concerned.</p>
      <p n="47">CHAPTER III</p>
      <p n="48">SPECIFIC MEASURE</p>
      <p n="49">Article 3</p>
