      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant-protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/49/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Directive 91/414/EEC provides for the development of a Community list of active substances authorised for incorporation in plant-protection products.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) A dossier for the active substance Novaluron was submitted by Makhteshim Agan Ltd, United Kingdom, to the authorities of the United Kingdom on 29 March 2001 with an application to obtain its inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. For the active substance Laminarin an application was submitted by Laboratoires GoÃ«mar SA, France, to the authorities of Belgium on 29 March 2001.</p>

The dossiers submitted appear also to satisfy the data and information requirements of Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC in respect of one plant-protection product containing the active substance concerned. In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the dossiers were subsequently forwarded by the respective applicants to the Commission and other Member States, and were referred to the Standing Committee on Plant Health.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) By this Decision it should be formally confirmed at Community level that the dossiers are considered as satisfying in principle the data and information requirements provided for in Annex II and, for at least one plant-protection product containing the active substance concerned, the requirements of Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) This Decision should not prejudice the right of the Commission to request the applicant to submit further data or information to the Member State designated as rapporteur in respect of a given substance in order to clarify certain points in the dossier.</p>

      <p n="21">The dossiers also satisfy the data and information requirements set out in Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC in respect of one plant-protection product containing the active substance, taking into account the uses proposed.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 2</p>
      <p n="23">The rapporteur Member States shall pursue the detailed examination for the dossiers concerned and shall report the conclusions of their examinations accompanied by any recommendations on the inclusion or non-inclusion of the active substance concerned in Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC and any conditions related thereto to the Commission as soon as possible and at the latest within a period of one year from the date of publication of this Decision in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
