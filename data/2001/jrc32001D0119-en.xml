      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 91/689/EEC of 12 December 1991 on hazardous waste(1), as last amended by Directive 94/31/EC(2), and in particular Article 1(4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) A Community list of hazardous waste was established by Council Decision 94/904/EC(3) and this Decision has been replaced by Commission Decision 2000/532/EC(4).</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Several Member States have notified end-of-life vehicles, not drained of liquids or other dangerous components as waste which they consider to display one of more of the properties listed in Annex III to Directive 91/689/EEC and have requested to list them as hazardous waste with the list set up under Article 1(4) of Directive 91/689/EEC.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Article 1(4) of Directive 91/689/EEC requires the Commission to examine these notifications from Member States with a view to amending the list of hazardous wastes.</p>

      <p n="16">(5) The measures laid down in this Decision were not in accordance with the opinion expressed by the aforementioned Committee and could therefore not be included in Commission Decision 2000/532/EC.</p>

      <p n="20">Article 1</p>
      <p n="21">The Annex to Decision 2000/532/EC of 3 May 2000 replacing Commission Decision 94/3/EC establishing a list of wastes pursuant to Article 1(a) of Council Directive 75/442/EEC on waste and Council Decision 94/904/EC establishing a list of hazardous waste pursuant to Article 1(4) of Council Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste is amended as follows:</p>
