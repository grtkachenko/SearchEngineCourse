      <p n="3">of 24 April 2001</p>
      <p n="4">updating part VI and Annexes 3, 6 and 13 of the Common Consular Instructions and Annexes 5(a), 6(a) and 8 to the Common Manual</p>
      <p n="5">(2001/329/EC)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 of 24 April 2001 reserving to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for examining visa applications(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 790/2001 of 24 April 2001 reserving to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for carrying out border checks and surveillance(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the initiative of Sweden,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Further to Council Decision 2000/777/EC of 1 December 2000 on the application of the Schengen acquis in Denmark, Finland and Sweden, and in Iceland and Norway(3) it is necessary to update Part VI and Annexes 3, 6 and 13 of the Common Consular Instructions on Visas for the diplomatic missions and consular posts (CCI)(4) and Annexes 5(a), 6(a) and 8 to the Common Manual (CM).</p>
      <p n="12">(2) This instrument builds on the Schengen acquis, in accordance with the Protocol integrating it into the framework of the European Union, as laid down by Annex A to Council Decision 1999/435/EC of 20 May 1999 concerning the definition of the Schengen acquis for the purpose of determining, in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty on European Union, the legal basis for each of the provisions or decisions which constitute the acquis(5).</p>
      <p n="13">(3) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not participating in the adoption of this instrument, and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this instrument aims to build upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, Denmark shall decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this instrument whether it will transpose it into its national law.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this instrument constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded on 18 May 1999 by the Council of the European Union and those two States(6). As a result of the procedures laid down in that Agreement, the rights and obligations arising from this instrument shall also apply to those two States and in relations between those two States and the Member States participating in this instrument.</p>
      <p n="15">(5) Pursuant to Article 1 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland and the United Kingdom are not participating in the adoption of this instrument. Consequently, and without prejudice to the provisions referred to in Article 4 of the Protocol, the provisions of this instrument apply neither to Ireland nor to the United Kingdom,</p>
