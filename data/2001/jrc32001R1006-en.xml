      <p n="21">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="22">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1432/94(18), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1377/2000(19), lays down detailed rules for the application in the pigmeat sector of the import arrangements provided for in Regulation (EC) No 774/94 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for pigmeat and certain other agricultural products.</p>
      <p n="23">(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1486/95(20), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1378/2000(21), opens and provides for the administration of a tariff quota in the pigmeat sector.</p>
      <p n="24">(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2305/95(22), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2867/2000(23), establishes detailed rules for application in the pigmeat sector of the arrangements provided for in the free trade agreements between the Community, of the one part, and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, of the other part.</p>
      <p n="25">(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 571/97(24), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2868/2000(25), establishes detailed rules for the application in the pigmeat sector of the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related measures between the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Slovenia, of the other part.</p>
      <p n="26">(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/97(26), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2866/2000(27), lays down rules of application in the pigmeat sector for the arrangements covered by Regulations (EC) No 1727/2000, (EC) No 2290/2000, (EC) No 2433/2000, (EC) No 2434/2000, (EC) No 2435/2000 and (EC) No 2851/2000 and repeals Commission Regulations (EEC) 2698/93(28) and (EC) No 1590/94(29).</p>
      <p n="27">(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2562/98(30) lays down detailed rules for the application of the arrangements applicable to imports of certain pigmeat products originating in the ACP States and repeals Commission Regulation (EEC) No 904/90(31).</p>
      <p n="28">(7) The validity of import licences should expire at the end of each quota year on 31 December or 30 June. In order to provide for a possibility for continuous trade under the pigmeat import regimes and to ensure administrative efficiency, it is necessary to advance the application periods for import licences to the preceding month of each quarter. In order to ensure sufficiently expeditious issuing of licences, it is necessary to restrict the period within which the applications can be lodged from 10 days to 7 days.</p>
      <p n="29">(8) In order to ensure proper management of the quantities under Regulations (EC) No 2305/95 and (EC) No 2562/98, it is necessary to set a final date for the validity of licences at the end of each quota year.</p>
      <p n="30">(9) In order to facilitate trade of pigmeat and to harmonise the levels of securities for import licences within the meat sectors it is necessary to review the level of security set in Regulation (EC) No 2562/98.</p>
      <p n="31">(10) To ensure proper management of the import regimes, the Commission needs precise information from the Member States on the quantities actually imported. For the sake of clarity it is necessary to use a single model for communicating the quantities between Member States and the Commission.</p>
      <p n="32">(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,</p>
