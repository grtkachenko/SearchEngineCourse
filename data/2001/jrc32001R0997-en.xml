      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 997/2001 of 22 May 2001 amending Regulation (EC) No 805/1999 laying down certain measures for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 on a Community-fleet capacity policy to promote inland waterway transport</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 997/2001</p>
      <p n="3">of 22 May 2001</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 805/1999 laying down certain measures for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 on a Community-fleet capacity policy to promote inland waterway transport</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 of 29 March 1999 on a Community-fleet capacity policy to promote inland waterway transport(1), and in particular Article 9(3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 requires the Commission to lay down detailed rules for implementing the Community-fleet capacity policy as defined by that Regulation.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 805/1999(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1532/2000(3), adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 718/1999, set ratios for the "old-for-new" rule to apply from 29 April 1999.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 requires the "old-for-new" ratio to be constantly reduced to bring it as quickly as possible and in regular stages to zero no later than 29 April 2003. A new "old-for-new" ratio should therefore be set for the year 2000.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Economic developments in the various sectors of the inland waterways transport market make it expedient to reduce the various "old-for-new" ratios mentioned in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 and set by Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 805/1999, though without undoing the achievements of the structural improvement carried out since 1990. The ratio for dry cargo carriers should be reduced to 0,80:1, as the sector is continuing to grow; the ratio for tanker vessels requires a smaller adjustment, to 1,15:1, as the situation in this sector remains worrying and the market is not growing; a larger adjustment is required for the pusher craft ratio, to 0,50:1, as overcapacity is not great in this sector.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The measures laid down in this Regulation have been the subject of an opinion from the Group of Experts on Community Fleets Capacity and Promotion Policy set up by Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 805/1999,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">Regulation (EC) No 805/1999 is amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="17">1. In Article 4(1), the ratio "1:1" is replaced by "0,80:1".</p>
      <p n="18">2. In Article 4(2), the ratio "1,30:1" is replaced by "1,15:1".</p>
      <p n="19">3. In Article 4(3), the ratio "0,75:1" is replaced by "0,50:1".</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 22 May 2001.</p>
      <p n="24">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="25">Loyola De Palacio</p>
      <p n="26">Vice-President</p>
      <p n="27">(1) OJ L 90, 2.4.1999, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="28">(2) OJ L 102, 17.4.1999, p. 64.</p>
      <p n="29">(3) OJ L 175, 14.7.2000, p. 74.</p>
