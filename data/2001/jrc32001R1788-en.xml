      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001</p>
      <p n="3">of 7 September 2001</p>
      <p n="4">laying down detailed rules for implementing the provisions concerning the certificate of inspection for imports from third countries under Article 11 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 436/2001(2), and in particular Article 11(3)(b) and (4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) It is necessary to determine a procedure in order to coordinate at Community level certain controls on products imported from third countries in view of these products being marketed with indications referring to the organic production method.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) For products imported under the procedure established in Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, the content of the certificate of inspection is foreseen in that Article. For products imported under the procedure established in Article 11(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, there is no such provision. It is therefore necessary to extend the use of that certificate to products imported under Article 11(6) in order to ensure that these products were manufactured according to production rules equivalent to those laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 and were subject to inspection measures of equivalent effectiveness to those referred to in Articles 8 and 9, and such inspection measures were permanently and effectively applied in the third country concerned.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3457/92(3) established a certificate of inspection for products imported from third countries according to the provisions laid down in Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. For reasons of clarity the said Regulation (EEC) No 3457/92 will be replaced by this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to the inspection system in Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 and in Annex III, Sections B and C, thereto.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to the Community customs provisions and any other provisions governing importation of products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 for marketing in the Community.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>

      <p n="18">2. This Regulation shall not apply to products which:</p>
      <p n="19">- are not intended for release for free circulation in the Community in unaltered state or after processing,</p>
      <p n="20">- are admitted free of import duties in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 918/83(4) setting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty. However, the Regulation shall apply to products admitted free of import duties in accordance with Articles 39 and 43 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>
      <p n="22">For the purposes of this Regulation:</p>

      <p n="37">(b) the authority or body which has been accepted for issuing the certificate of inspection under the procedure laid down in Article 11(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91.</p>
      <p n="38">4. The authority or body issuing the certificate of inspection shall:</p>
      <p n="39">(a) only issue the certificate of inspection and endorse the declaration in box 15, after it has carried out a documentary check on the basis of all relevant inspection documents, including in particular the production plan for the products concerned, transport documents and commercial documents, and after the authority or body has either made a physical check of the consignment concerned before it is expedited from the third country of dispatch, or has received an explicit declaration of the exporter declaring that the consignment concerned has been produced and/or prepared in accordance with the provisions which are implemented by the authority or body concerned in respect of the import and marketing in the European Community of products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 in accordance with Article 11(1) or (6) of that Regulation;</p>

      <p n="43">Uncertified alterations or erasures shall invalidate the certificate.</p>
      <p n="44">6. The certificate of inspection shall be made in one single original.</p>
      <p n="45">The first consignee or, where relevant, the importer may make a copy for the purpose of informing the inspection authority or body in accordance with Section C, point 3, of Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. Any such copy shall carry the indication "COPY" or "DUPLICATE" printed or stamped thereon.</p>
      <p n="46">7.

      <p n="47">8. The competent authority in the Member State which granted the authorisation may delegate the competence for the declaration in box 16 to the inspection authority or body inspecting the importer in accordance with Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, or to the authorities defined as the Member State's relevant authorities.</p>
      <p n="48">9. The declaration in box 16 is not required:</p>

      <p n="50">(b) when the Member State's authority, which granted the authorisation in Article 11(6), has given satisfactory evidence that the consignment is covered by that authorisation, directly to the authority in charge of the verification of the consignment. This procedure of direct information is optional for the Member State which granted the authorisation.</p>
      <p n="51">10. The document giving the evidence required for in subparagraphs 9(a) and (b), shall include:</p>

      <p n="60">Article 5</p>
      <p n="61">1. Where, under a suspensive customs procedure under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92(6) establishing the Community Customs Code, a consignment coming from a third country is intended to be submitted in a Member State, before its release for free circulation in the Community, to one or more preparations as defined in Article 4(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 and which may be carried under Articles 522(1) and 552(1)(a)(iv) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(7) laying down provisions for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92, the consignment must be subject, before the first preparation is carried out, to the measures referred to in Article 4(1) of the present Regulation.</p>

      <p n="76">Article 7</p>
      <p n="77">The relevant Member State's authorities and the authorities in the Member States responsible for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, as well as the inspection authorities and inspection bodies, shall assist each other in applying this Regulation.</p>
