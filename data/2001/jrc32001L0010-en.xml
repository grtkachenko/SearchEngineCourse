      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 152(4)(b) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>

      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) The animal health conditions for scrapie, covering placing on the market of animals, are laid down in Council Directive 91/68/EEC of 28 January 1991 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals(4).</p>
      <p n="13">(2) The Commission has obtained scientific opinions, in particular from the Scientific Steering Committee, on several aspects of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). The rules laid down in Directive 91/68/EEC should be reviewed in the light of those opinions.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Provisions should be laid down for all matters concerning TSEs to apply, in particular, to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin referred to in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down the rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(5).</p>
