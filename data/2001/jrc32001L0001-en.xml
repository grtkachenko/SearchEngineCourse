      <p n="3">of 22 January 2001</p>

      <p n="12">(2) Directive 70/220/EEC lays down the specifications for the testing of emissions of the motor vehicles falling within its scope.

      <p n="21">With effect from 1 January 2001 for new types and from 1 January 2002 for all types, vehicles of category N1 classes II and III and vehicles of category M1, the maximum mass of which exceeds 2500 kg, must be fitted with an OBD system for emission control in accordance with Annex XI.</p>
      <p n="22">8.1.2. LPG and natural gas fuelled vehicles</p>
      <p n="23">With effect from 1 January 2003 for new types and from 1 January 2004 for all types, vehicles of category M1 - except vehicles the maximum mass of which exceeds 2500 kg - and vehicles of category N1 class I, running permanently or part-time on either LPG or natural gas fuel, must be fitted with an OBD system for emission control in accordance with Annex XI.</p>

      <p n="33">Done at Brussels, 22 January 2001.</p>
