      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1564/2001 of 31 July 2001 amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 as regards vacuum-packing of certain cuts of intervention beef and correcting Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1564/2001</p>
      <p n="3">of 31 July 2001</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 as regards vacuum-packing of certain cuts of intervention beef and correcting Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1512/2001(2), and in particular Article 47(8) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 of 15 March 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1082/2001(4), lays down in particular rules on the packing of cuts immediately after boning of the meat and specific requirements for intervention boning.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) On the basis of experience, it is necessary to clarify the situation with regard to the possibility of vacuum-packing certain individual cuts of intervention beef. Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Article 1(2)(b) of the English version of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 of 20 June 2001 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1496/2001(6), contains an error. Therefore, this Regulation should be corrected.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">In Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 562/2000, the following point 3 is added: "3. VACUUM-PACKING OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL CUTS</p>
      <p n="16">Member States may decide to allow vacuum-packing instead of individual wrapping as provided for under point 1 for cuts of codes INT 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 19."</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1(2)(b) of the English version of Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 shall read as follows: "(b) the following may be bought into intervention: five-rib forequarters obtained using a straight cut from the carcasses or half carcasses referred to in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000; the price of forequarters shall be calculated by applying the coefficient 0,80 to the carcass price."</p>
      <p n="19">Article 3</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="22">Done at Brussels, 31 July 2001.</p>
      <p n="23">For the Commission</p>
