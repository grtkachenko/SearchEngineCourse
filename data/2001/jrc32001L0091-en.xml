      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>

      <p n="11">(2) There is no longer a need for derogations and Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC should be adapted to technical progress for hexachloroethane by deleting the derogations.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) The restrictions on the use of hexachloroethane laid down by this Directive take into account the current state of knowledge and techniques regarding suitable alternatives.</p>
