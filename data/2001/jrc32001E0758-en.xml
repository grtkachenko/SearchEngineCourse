      <head n="1">2001/758/CFSP: Council Common Position of 29 October 2001 on combating the illicit traffic in conflict diamonds, as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts</head>
      <p n="2">Council Common Position</p>
      <p n="3">of 29 October 2001</p>
      <p n="4">on combating the illicit traffic in conflict diamonds, as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts</p>
      <p n="5">(2001/758/CFSP)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Conflict diamonds fuel some of the bloodiest conflicts in Africa. There is a clear need for measures to be taken to help prevent and resolve conflicts.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) On 11 and 12 May 2000 Kimberley (South Africa) saw the start of the eponymous process, bringing the main diamond exporting, processing and importing countries together with representatives of the diamond industry and civil society in order to discuss and introduce measures to eliminate the market in conflict diamonds.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Over the successive stages of the Kimberley process, the aim has gradually hardened into establishing an international certification scheme for rough diamonds, based on national certification schemes and on agreed minimum standards at international level.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) On 29 October 2001 the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate an international certification scheme in the framework of a binding international agreement.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) On 1 December 2000 the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 55/56/2000 on breaking the link between illicit transactions in rough diamonds and armed conflict, as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts. The role of rough diamonds in conflicts is on the agenda for the 56th session of the General Assembly.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) The United Nations Security Council has also adopted Resolutions - 1173(1998), 1295(2000), 1306(2000) and 1304(2000) - taking restrictive measures against the rebel movements in Sierra Leone and Angola and against the government of Liberia. The Council, too, has adopted restrictive measures pursuant to those Resolutions.</p>
      <p n="15">(7) In June 2001, in GÃ¶teborg, the European Council adopted a programme for the prevention of violent conflicts, which states in particular that combating illegal trade in diamonds is a factor in conflict prevention.</p>
      <p n="16">(8) On 14 May 2001 the European Union adopted Common Position 2001/374/CFSP concerning conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa(1), which states in particular that the Union will cooperate in promoting universal respect for embargoes related to the illegal exploitation of and trade in high-value commodities,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS COMMON POSITION:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
      <p n="19">The European Union and its Member States shall support and contribute to the efforts of the international community to break the link between conflict diamonds and the financing of armed conflict.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">The European Union notes that the community is to conduct negotiations to establish an international certification scheme in the context of a binding international agreement.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 3</p>
      <p n="23">To promote the objective stated in Article 1, Member States will:</p>
      <p n="24">- discuss the question of conflict diamonds in the context of their bilateral or multilateral relations,</p>
      <p n="25">- consult, particularly in the United Nations and the fora concerned, on the most effective means of combating conflict diamonds,</p>
      <p n="26">- call on the countries chiefly concerned to support and join the multilateral agreement drawn up under the Kimberley process.</p>
      <p n="27">Article 4</p>
      <p n="28">This Common Position shall take effect on the day of its adoption.</p>
      <p n="29">Article 5</p>
      <p n="30">This Common Position shall be published in the Official Journal.</p>
      <p n="31">Done at Luxembourg, 29 October 2001.</p>
      <p n="32">For the Council</p>
      <p n="33">The President</p>
      <p n="34">L. Michel</p>
      <p n="35">(1) OJ L 132, 15.5.2001, p. 3.</p>
