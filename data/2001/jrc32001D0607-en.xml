      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that the eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria shall be established according to product groups.</p>

      <p n="29">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="30">Margot Wallstr√∂m</p>
      <p n="31">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="32">(1) OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="33">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="34">FRAMEWORK</p>
      <p n="35">In order to qualify for the eco-label, a hand dishwashing detergent (hereinafter referred to as "the product" must fall within the product group as defined in Article 1, and must comply with the criteria of this Annex, with tests carried out on application as indicated in the criteria and the technical appendix. Where appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body or bodies assessing the application (hereinafter referred to as the "competent body"). Where no tests are mentioned, or are mentioned as being for use in verification or monitoring, competent bodies should rely, as appropriate, on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications. Where it is indicated that specific documentation and/or declarations are required, these shall be provided by the applicant and/or the manufacturer(s) and/or the supplier(s) as appropriate. Where ingredients are referred to, this includes substances and preparations.</p>
      <p n="36">The competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex (Note:</p>
      <p n="37">it is not required to implement such management schemes.)</p>
      <p n="38">These criteria aim in particular at promoting:</p>
      <p n="39">- the reduction of discharges of toxic or otherwise polluting substances into the aquatic environment,</p>
      <p n="40">- the reduction or prevention of risks to health or the environment related to the use of hazardous substances,</p>
      <p n="41">- the minimisation of packaging waste,</p>
      <p n="42">- information that will enable the consumer to use the product in the way that is efficient and minimises environmental impact.</p>
      <p n="43">The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of hand dishwashing detergents that have a low environmental impact.</p>
      <p n="44">ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA</p>
      <p n="45">1. Toxicity to aquatic organisms</p>
      <p n="46">The critical dilution volume toxicity (CDVtox) is calculated for each ingredient (i) using the following equation:</p>
      <p n="47">&gt;PIC FILE= "L_2001214EN.003102.TIF"&gt;</p>
      <p n="48">where weight (i) is the weight of the ingredient per recommended dose for 1 l of dishwashing water, LF is the loading factor and LTE is the long-term toxicity effect concentration of the ingredient.</p>
      <p n="49">The values of the LF and LTE parameters shall be as given in the detergent ingredient database list (DID list) in Appendix IA. If the ingredient in question is not included in the DID list, the applicant shall estimate their values following the approach described in Appendix IB. The CDVtox is summed for each ingredient, making the CDVtox for the product.</p>
      <p n="50">The CDVtox of the recommended dose expressed for 1 l of dishwashing water shall not exceed 170 l.</p>
      <p n="51">The exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the competent body, together with the details of the CDVtox calculations showing compliance with this criterion.</p>
      <p n="52">2. Biodegradabiltiy of surfactants</p>
      <p n="53">(a) Ready biodegradability (aerobic)</p>
      <p n="54">Each surfactant used in the product shall be readily biodegradable.</p>
      <p n="55">The exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the competent body. The DID list (see Appendix IA) indicates whether a specific surfactant is aerobically biodegradable or not (i.e. those that have an entry of "Y" in the column on aerobic biodegradabiltiy shall not be used). For surfactants which are not included in the DID list, the relevant information from literature or other sources, or appropriate test results, showing that they are aerobically biodegradable shall be provided. The tests for ready biodegradabiltiy shall be as referred to in Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances(1), and its subsequent amendments, in particular the methods detailed in Annex V.C4, or their equivalent OECD 301 A-F test methods, or their equivalent ISO tests. The 10 days window principle shall not apply. The pass levels shall be 70 % for the tests referred to in Annex V.C4-A and C.4-B of Directive 67/548/EEC (and their equivalent OECD 301 A and E tests and ISO equivalent), and shall be 60 % for tests C4-C, D, E and F (and their equivalent OECD 301 B, F, D and tests and ISO equivalents).</p>
      <p n="56">(b) Anaerobic biodegradability</p>
      <p n="57">Each surfactant used in the product shall be biodegradable under anaerobic conditions.</p>
      <p n="58">The exact formulation of the product shall be provided. The DID list (see Appendix IA) indicates whether a specific surfactant is anaerobically biodegradable or not (i.e. those that have an entry of "Y" in the column on anaerobic biodegradability shall not be used). For surfactants which are not included in the DID list, the relevant information from literature or other sources, or appropriate test results, showing that they are anaerobically biodegradable shall be provided. The reference test for anaerobic degradability shall be ISO 11734, ECETOC No 28 (June 1988) or equivalent test method, with the requirement of a minimum of 60 % degradability under anaerobic conditions.</p>
      <p n="59">3. Dangerous, hazardous or toxic substances or preparations</p>
      <p n="60">(a) The following ingredients shall not be included in the product, either as part of the formulation or as part of any preparation included in the formulation:</p>

      <p n="90">Each ingredient of any preparation used in the formulation that exceeds 0,1 % by weight of the preparation shall also meet the above requirement.</p>
      <p n="91">Biocides that are used to preserve the product (as allowed under the criterion on biocides below), and are classified as R50+53 or R51+53 are nevertheless permitted, but only if they are not potentially bio-accumulative.

      <p n="107">The texts and layouts used on each type of packaging and/or an example of each different type of packaging shall be provided to the competent body, together with a declaration of compliance with this criterion.</p>
      <p n="108">7. Sensitising substances</p>
      <p n="109">The product shall not be classified as R42 (may cause sensitisation by inhalation) and/or R43 (may cause sensitisation by skin contact) according to Directive 1999/45/EC concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations.</p>

This shall at least include the results of a performance test comparing the product (at the recommended dosage, tested on dirty dishes, in realistic conditions) with water and at least one other product (commonly available in the area where the eco-labelled product is to be marketed, and at its recommended dosage). The choice of the reference product(s) and test protocol used for these comparisons shall be justified. The applicant may use, for example, the test method entitled "Dishwashing" established by the CTTN-IREN.</p>

      <p n="133">(c) An indication of the approximate number of washes that the consumer can perform with one bottle.</p>
      <p n="134">This is calculated by dividing the volume of the product by the dosage required for 5 l of dishwashing water for dirty dishes (as indicated in the pictogram above).</p>
      <p n="135">(d) Commission recommendation 89/542/EEC of 13 September 1989 for the labelling of detergents and cleaning products(6) shall be applied.</p>
