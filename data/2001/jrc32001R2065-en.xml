      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 939/2001(2), and in particular Article 4(4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 provides that certain fishery products may be offered for retail sale only on condition that a number of requirements regarding consumer information are met. The scope of that obligation should be specified.</p>

      <p n="12">(3) The requirements governing consumer information, in particular as regards the commercial designation and method of production of a species, and the area in which it is caught, should be specified.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) Small quantities of products may only be exempt from the obligation regarding marking or labelling if they comply with a number of requirements, which should be defined.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) The scope of the information to be passed on throughout the marketing chain should be specified.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) Provision should be made for the Member States to establish arrangements for checking the traceability of products covered by this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="20">Article 1</p>
      <p n="21">Without prejudice to the provisions applicable pursuant to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(3), this Regulation shall apply to the fishery and aquaculture products included on the lists and covered by the presentations falling within Chapter 3 of the Combined Nomenclature which are marketed within the Community, irrespective of their origin, including products that are prepackaged.</p>
      <p n="22">CHAPTER II</p>

      <p n="25">1. Any species not included on the list of commercial designations accepted by a Member State may be marketed under a provisional commercial designation laid down by the competent authority of the Member State. A definitive commercial designation included on the list of accepted designations shall be laid down by the Member State within five months of the date on which the species in question is given the provisional commercial designation.</p>
      <p n="26">2. Any changes to the list of commercial designations accepted by a Member State shall be notified forthwith to the Commission, which shall inform the other Member States thereof.</p>
      <p n="27">Article 3</p>
      <p n="28">For the purposes of applying Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the commercial designation of a species shall be as established in each Member State in accordance with Article 4(2) of that Regulation.</p>
      <p n="29">Operators may also indicate the scientific name of the species concerned upon sale to the final consumer.</p>
      <p n="30">Article 4</p>

      <p n="64">2. Where a combination is offered for sale consisting of the same species but derived from a variety of production methods, the method for each batch must be indicated. Where a combination is offered for sale consisting of the same species but derived from a variety of catch areas or fishfarming countries, at least the area of the batch which is most representative in terms of quantity must be stated, together with an indication that the products also come from different catch or fishfarming areas.</p>
      <p n="65">Article 7</p>
      <p n="66">For the purposes of applying Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, each Member State shall determine the small quantities of products sold directly to consumers, provided that these do not exceed the value of EUR 20 for each purchase.
