      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 790/2000 laying down the marketing standard for tomatoes</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Article 2(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) The Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 790/2000 of 14 April 2000 laying down the marketing standard for tomatoes(3) lays down provisions concerning the classification of tomatoes.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) In order to ensure transparency on the world market, those provisions should be amended.

      <p n="14">The third indent of point (iii) (Class II) of Part B (Classification) of title II (Provisions concerning quality) of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 790/2000 is replaced by the following text: "- healed cracks not more than 3 cm in length for round, ribbed or oblong tomatoes."</p>
      <p n="15">Article 2</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="17">It shall apply from the first day of the second month following its entry into force.</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="19">Done at Brussels, 10 April 2001.</p>
