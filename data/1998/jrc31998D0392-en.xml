      <p n="6">Having regard to the assent of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the European Community is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (hereinafter referred to as 'the Convention`) and the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI thereof (hereinafter referred to as 'the Agreement`);</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the Convention and the Agreement have entered into force and a majority of the Community's Member States are parties to them; whereas the ratification process is under way in the other Member States;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the conditions permitting the Community to deposit the instrument of formal confirmation provided for in Article 3 of Annex IX to the Convention and referred to in Article 4(4) of the Agreement have been fulfilled;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the Community has been applying the Agreement and Part XI of the Convention provisionally since 16 November 1994 and is currently a provisional member of the International Seabed Authority;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the Convention and the Agreement should be approved to enable the Community to become a party to them within the limits of its competence;</p>

      <p n="13">Whereas the Community at this stage declines to choose a specific dispute-settlement procedure under Article 287 of the Convention; whereas this decision will, however, be reviewed within a specified period;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the Community and its Member States are involved in the work of the International Seabed Authority and must therefore coordinate the positions they will take in that organisation,</p>
