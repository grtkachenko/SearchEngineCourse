      <p n="8">Whereas the provisions of this Directive are in line with the opinion of the Committee on Adaptation to Technical Progress introduced by Council Directive 74/150/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 97/54/EC,</p>

      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">1. From 1 May 1999 no Member State may:</p>
      <p n="15">- refuse, in respect of a type of tractor, to grant EC type-approval, to issue the document referred to in the third indent of Article 10(1) of Council Directive 74/150/EEC, or to grant national type-approval, or</p>
      <p n="16">- to prohibit the entry into service of tractors,</p>
      <p n="17">if those tractors meet the requirements of Directive 75/321/EEC, as amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="18">2. From 1 October 1999, Member States:</p>
      <p n="19">- may no longer issue the document referred to in the third indent of Article 10(1) of Directive 74/150/EEC for any type of tractor that does not meet the requirements of Directive 75/321/EEC, as amended by this Directive,</p>
      <p n="20">- may refuse to grant national type-approval in respect of any type of tractor that does not meet the requirements of Directive 75/321/EEC, as amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 3</p>
      <p n="22">1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary in order to comply with this Directive not later than 30 April 1999. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>

      <p n="24">2. Member States shall transmit to the Commission the text of the essential provisions of national law that they adopt in the area covered by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 4</p>
      <p n="26">This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="27">Article 5</p>
      <p n="28">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
