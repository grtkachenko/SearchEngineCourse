      <p n="11">Whereas for the authorisation of new methods offering equivalent guarantees, it is appropriate to provide for a procedure of close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States analogous to those set out in Article 16 of Directive 64/433/EEC or in Article 21 of Directive 71/118/EEC or in Article 32 of Directive 90/539/EEC,</p>
