      <p n="6">Whereas Directive 70/524/EEC provides that new additives or uses of additives may be authorised, taking account of advances in scientific and technical knowledge;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas a provisional authorisation of new additives or uses of additives may be given for a period of five years, if, at the level permitted in feedingstuffs, it does not adversely affect human or animal health or the environment, nor harm the consumer by altering the characteristics of livestock product, if its presence in feedingstuffs can be controlled, and it is reasonable to assume, in view of the available results, that it has a favourable effect on the characteristics of those feedingstuffs or on livestock production when incorporated in such feedingstuffs;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas research into various additives referred to in Article 9e(3) of Directive 70/524/EEC which can be authorised provisionally at national level until 30 November 1998 has not yet been completed; whereas, therefore, the period of authorisation of these substances should be extended taking into account that the period of provisional authorisation of these additives can not exceed five years;</p>

      <p n="10">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs,</p>
      <p n="11">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="12">Article 1</p>
      <p n="13">Additives referred to in the Annex to this Regulation may be authorised in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC under the conditions laid down in this Annex.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="16">It shall apply with effect from 1 December 1998.</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
