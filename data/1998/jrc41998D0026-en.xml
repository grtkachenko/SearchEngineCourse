      <head n="1">The Schengen acquis - Decision of the Executive Committee of 16 September 1998 setting up a Standing Committee on the evaluation and implementation of Schengen (SCH/ Com-ex (98) 26 def.)</head>
      <p n="2">DECISION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</p>
      <p n="3">of 16 September 1998</p>
      <p n="4">setting up a Standing Committee on the evaluation and implementation of Schengen</p>
      <p n="5">(SCH/ Com-ex (98)26 def.)</p>
      <p n="6">THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Article 132 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Article 7 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Joint Declaration concerning Article 139 in the Final Act annexed to the Convention,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the initiative to set up the Standing Committee stems from a concern for complementarity with existing instruments within the European Union;</p>
      <p n="11">Mindful of the need to observe the principle of national sovereignty;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas this Committee may in due course have to be adapted to take account of the operational framework of the European Union,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="14">A Standing Committee on the evaluation and implementation of Schengen (hereinafter "the Standing Committee") shall be set up under the aegis of the Executive Committee, firstly to establish whether all the preconditions for bringing the Convention into force in a candidate State thereto have been fulfilled and secondly to ensure that the Schengen acquis is properly applied by the States already implementing the Convention, notably by pinpointing problems and proposing solutions.</p>
      <p n="15">The Standing Committee shall have sole responsibility for drafting the reports with a view to evaluating the preparations by the candidate States to bring the Schengen Convention into force and verifying that all of the preconditions for the practical application of the Schengen Convention and the abolition of checks at the internal borders have been fulfilled.</p>
      <p n="16">The second task of the Standing Committee shall be to lay the foundations so that the Executive Committee can ensure the proper application of the Schengen Convention by the States which have already brought it into force, in particular by following up the recommendations made by the visiting committees to the external borders, by ensuring that follow-up action is taken to remedy the shortcomings mentioned in the Annual Report on the External Borders, by focusing greater attention on the joint efforts needed to improve the quality of controls at the external borders and by optimising the application of the Convention in the fields of police cooperation, judicial cooperation and the SIS. The Standing Committee shall seek solutions to the problems detected and shall make proposals for the satisfactory and optimal implementation of the Convention. Sole responsibility for checking to ensure that the Convention is properly applied shall continue to remain with the Schengen States. The Standing Committee shall therefore confine itself to carrying out the verification procedures as defined in the following mandate.</p>
      <p n="17">These two tasks warrant the Standing Committee being awarded two separate mandates:</p>
      <p n="18">1. to prepare the reports to serve as a basis for establishing that all the preconditions for bringing the Schengen Convention into force in a candidate State have been satisfied. In these cases it shall be called the "Evaluation Committee", and shall be in charge of evaluating how well these States are prepared;</p>
      <p n="19">2. to lay the foundations so that the Executive Committee can ensure the proper application of the Convention in the States already implementing the Convention with a view to optimising its application and cooperation between the Schengen partners. First, it has to find solutions to problems encountered since the bringing into force of the Convention and make proposals on improving controls in accordance with the objectives set and the spirit of the Convention. Here, it shall be called the "Implementation Committee".</p>
      <p n="20">I. EVALUATION COMMITTEE FOR CANDIDATE STATES TO BRING THE CONVENTION INTO FORCE</p>
      <p n="21">1. TASKS OF THE EVALUATION COMMITTEE</p>
      <p n="22">Each time a State is a candidate to bring the Convention into force, the Standing Committee, acting in the context of its evaluation remit, shall draw up a report laying down a list of the criteria to be satisfied by the candidate States. This list shall indicate precisely the standard to be reached in all of the areas covered by the Convention. Once these criteria have been approved by the Executive Committee, the Standing Committee shall verify in another report whether a candidate State to bring the Convention into force satisfies the criteria and complies with the standard required.</p>
      <p n="23">In each of the Committee's spheres of competence, it may instruct a group of competent experts to draft a report in its specific field. These reports shall deal with the qualitative, quantitative, operational, administrative and organisational aspects and should pinpoint shortcomings or weaknesses, whilst proposing solutions.</p>
      <p n="24">2. SPHERES OF COMPETENCE</p>
      <p n="25">The Committee shall draft a detailed and exhaustive report and shall assess how well prepared the candidate States to bring into force the Schengen Convention are in all of the fields referred to in Decision SCH/Com-ex (93) 10 of 14 December 1993 and shall ensure that all of the preconditions for implementing the Schengen acquis are respected. The assessment shall cover the following areas in particular:</p>
      <p n="26">- checks at the external borders, in particular the application of the Common Manual,</p>
      <p n="27">- surveillance of external land and sea borders,</p>

      <p n="38">On the one hand, the Standing Committee shall take as its basis the following tasks in the areas relating to external borders, police cooperation, the SIS and visas; on the other, it shall draw up a list of tasks to be carried out by the experts in the other areas:</p>
      <p n="39">(a) Controls at the external borders and migratory flows, including bilateral and multilateral cooperation with third States and the question of readmission</p>
      <p n="40">Taking into account the local geographical situation and depending on the kind of external borders in the visited State, the experts shall:</p>

      <p n="94">The Standing Committee shall provide the scope for detecting any problems encountered at external borders and for identifying situations which do not comply with the standard set in accordance with the spirit and objectives of the Convention. By means of the Standing Committee, the State visited and the Executive Committee shall be informed of the problems encountered, together with solutions proposed for applying the Convention in a satisfactory and most effective manner. As for any problems encountered since the bringing into force of the Convention, it shall be up to the Committee to make technical proposals to improve checks, security and judicial cooperation, including extradition.</p>
      <p n="95">The Committee shall also check whether the recommendations and observations put forward by the visiting committees to external borders have been acted upon and have enabled any shortcomings in security to be overcome.

      <p n="137">III. PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE STANDING COMMITTEE</p>
      <p n="138">Composition of the Standing Committee</p>
      <p n="139">The Committee shall be a standing body. It shall be composed of one high-ranking representative from each Signatory State to the Convention or to the Cooperation Agreement. (This high-ranking representative may be accompanied). The Standing Committee shall be assisted by the Secretariat in connection with its meetings and various tasks.</p>
      <p n="140">The Standing Committee shall visit all of the countries, in an order and at intervals to be laid down by the Executive Committee.</p>
      <p n="141">For the performance of their tasks, the permanent members shall be able to call on the Schengen States to second temporarily experts in each of the Committee's areas of competence, in particular for the purpose of carrying out the assignments in the countries, in line with the arrangements defined by the permanent members. Certain assignments involving experts may be carried out jointly or may focus on one area. Each State shall be entitled to appoint an expert to perform assignments in the framework of the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee shall, however, endeavour to maintain membership of the delegations at a level that is compatible with the technical constraints of the assignments.</p>
      <p n="142">Where there are several visits taking place at the same time involving groups of experts specialising in each of the specific areas, a coordination meeting shall be organised with all the experts before the end of the visit.</p>
      <p n="143">The experts must have the requisite qualifications and, in general, it would be desirable for the same experts to be designated each time.</p>
      <p n="144">The European Commission shall participate as an observer in the Standing Committee's work and in the activities of the working groups which serve the Committee, the Central Group and the Executive Committee.</p>
      <p n="145">Joint Supervisory Authority</p>
      <p n="146">The Standing Committee shall carry out its tasks without prejudice to the powers of the Joint Supervisory Authority. The Committee shall be authorised to consult the Authority in areas within its sphere of competence.</p>
      <p n="147">Locations to be visited</p>
      <p n="148">The Standing Committee shall, in conjunction with the respective working groups, select the locations to be visited and the information to be gathered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p n="149">Language arrangements</p>
      <p n="150">Details of the language arrangements to be used during the visits shall be determined for each visit.</p>
      <p n="151">Facilitating the activities of the Committee</p>
      <p n="152">The authorities of the visited State shall ensure that its authorities afford the Committee the cooperation and assistance it requires to enable it to perform its tasks properly. The visited State must provide the Committee with the relevant information on the locations to be visited and all useful statistical, factual, analytical or other information (in one of the official Schengen languages) at least one month before the start of the visit.</p>
      <p n="153">Reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses incurred during the visits</p>
      <p n="154">The costs of travel and accommodation are to be met by the Committee members or their experts. The host State shall bear the costs of the logistical support in situ.</p>
      <p n="155">Drafting of the report</p>
      <p n="156">The report shall be drafted on the basis of a standard model to be laid down by the Standing Committee in consultation with the competent working groups. The model may be adjusted according to needs and circumstances.</p>
      <p n="157">A preliminary draft of the report shall be written by the Presidency and submitted to the group of experts, who shall seek a consensus on how the report should be drafted. The representatives of the host State shall have observer status within this group. Once the report has been drawn up by the experts, it shall be submitted to the host State, which may draft an opinion. The report and the opinion shall be submitted to the Standing Committee, which shall attempt to find a consensus between the two documents. With regard to points that remain contentious, the Committee shall put the position of each of the Parties.</p>
      <p n="158">The reports must clearly show in which areas the objectives have been reached and those in which this is not the case, together with concrete proposals for measures to take with a view to remedying or improving the situation. Responsibility for adopting the final decision shall in any case rest with the Executive Committee.</p>
      <p n="159">Confidentiality</p>
      <p n="160">The Committee members and the experts shall regard as confidential the information they acquire in the course of performing their duties. The reports drawn up pursuant to this Decision shall be regarded as confidential.</p>
