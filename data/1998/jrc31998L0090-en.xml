      <p n="10">Whereas with a view to the practical application of Directive 70/387/EEC, it is necessary to ensure that uniform provisions exist in all Member States;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the adaption to technical progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC,</p>

      <p n="27">for a new type of vehicle on grounds relating to vehicle doors if the requirements of Directive 70/387/EEC, as amended by this Directive, are not fulfilled.</p>
      <p n="28">Article 3</p>
      <p n="29">1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 1998 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>

      <p n="201">2.1.2. A maximum discontinuity of 100 mm in the holding area of the handrails or handholds or equivalent holding devices may be allowed (for instance intermediate fixation).</p>
      <p n="202">2.1.3. In the case of access with more than two steps the handrails, handholds or equivalent holding devices shall be located so that a person may support himself at the same time at three points (with two hands and one foot or with two feet and one hand).</p>
      <p n="203">2.1.4. Except in the case of a stairway, the design and positioning of the handrails, handholds and equivalent holding devices must be such that operators are encouraged to descend facing the cab.</p>
      <p n="204">2.1.5. The steering wheel may be considered as a handhold.</p>
      <p n="205">2.2. The height (N) of the lower edge of at least one handrail or handhold or equivalent holding device, measured from the ground with the vehicle in running order on a horizontal and flat surface, shall not be more than 1 850 mm.</p>
      <p n="206">2.2.1. However, for off-road vehicles (see 1.1.1), such distance (N) may be increased up to 1 950 mm.</p>
      <p n="207">2.2.2. If the floor of the driver's compartment has a height from the ground greater than "N", this height shall be assumed as "N".</p>
      <p n="208">2.2.3. In addition, the minimum distance "P" of the upper edge of the handrail(s) or handholds or equivalent holding devices from the uppermost step (floor of the driver's compartment) shall be:</p>
      <p n="209">- handrail(s) or handholds or equivalent holding devices (U) 650 mm,</p>
      <p n="210">- handrail(s) or handholds or equivalent holding devices (V) 550 mm.</p>
      <p n="211">2.3. The following geometrical specifications shall be fulfilled:</p>
      <p n="212">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="213">&gt;REFERENCE TO A FILM&gt;</p>
      <p n="214">3. In the case of a sloped floor of the driver's compartment the required measurements shall be made from a horizontal plane passing through a point which is given by the intersection of the front edge of the floor with a vertical plane through the centre of the step immediately below and which is perpendicular to the longitudinal medium plane of the vehicle.`</p>
