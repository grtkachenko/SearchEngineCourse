      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 779/98 of 7 April 1998 on the import into the Community of agricultural products originating in Turkey, repealing Regulation (EEC) No 4115/86 and amending Regulation (EC) No 3010/95 (1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat (2), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2916/95 (3), and in particular Article 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 25 February 1998 on the trade regime for agricultural products (4) establishes the system of preferences applicable to imports into the Community of agricultural products originating in Turkey;</p>

      <p n="9">Whereas provision should be made for the administration of these arrangements by means of import licences; whereas, to that end, notwithstanding Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1044/98 (6), detailed rules for submission of applications and the particulars which should appear in applications and licences should be laid down; whereas, in addition, provision should be made for licences to be issued after a period of consideration, applying, where necessary, a single acceptance rate;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, in order to ensure regular imports, the quantities laid down in Annex I to this Regulation should be staggered over the year;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, in order to ensure proper administration of the system, the security for import licences under the said system should be fixed at ECU 20 per 100 kilograms; whereas, in view of the likelihood of speculation inherent in the system in the poultrymeat sector, precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the attention of traders should be drawn to the fact that licences may be used only for products that comply with all the veterinary requirements in force in the Community;</p>
