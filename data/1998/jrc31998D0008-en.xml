      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, bovine and caprine animals and swine and fresh meat or meat products from third countries (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Articles 4 (1) and 18 (1) (a) and (b) thereof,</p>

      <p n="9">Whereas Community on-the-spot inspections have shown that the hygiene standards of these establishments are sufficient and they may therefore be entered on a first list of establishments, drawn up in accordance with Article 4 (1) of that Directive, from which imports of fresh meat may be authorized;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas imports of fresh meat from the establishments on the list in the Annex hereto continue to be subject to provisions already laid down, the general provisions of the Treaty and in particular the other Community veterinary regulations, particularly as regards health protection;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">1. The establishments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia listed in the Annex are hereby approved for the purposes of exporting fresh meat to the Community.</p>
