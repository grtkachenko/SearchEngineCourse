      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, for the reasons given below, the following Directives on the marketing of seed and propagating material should be amended:</p>

      <p n="15">- Council Directive 70/458/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the marketing of vegetable seed (10);</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas Commission Decision 89/540/EEC of 22 September 1989 on the organisation of a temporary experiment on the marketing of seeds and propagating material (11), organised a temporary experiment under specified conditions, with the aim of assessing whether unofficial field inspections could ensure simplification of the procedures for official seed certification required under Directives 66/400/EEC, 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC and 69/208/EEC without a significant decrease in the quality of the seed;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas the results of the experiment have shown that, for certain purposes, there could be a simplification of the procedures for official seed certification of 'certified seed` of all categories, if inspections were allowed to be carried out by inspectors other than those charged with official examination by the seed certification authority;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas administrative developments have taken place in the Member States;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas Directives 66/400/EEC, 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC and 69/208/EEC should be amended accordingly;</p>

      <p n="24">Whereas, in the light of experience, it is desirable to extend the scope of the organization of such experiments for the purpose of seeking improved alternatives to certain provisions set out in the said directives;</p>
      <p n="25">Whereas it is desirable to provide a legal base in Directive 66/403/EEC for the organization of temporary experiments for the purpose of seeking improved alternatives to certain provisions set out in that directive;</p>
      <p n="26">Whereas it is desirable to provide in Directives 70/457/EEC and 70/458/EEC for rules in relation to the suitability of varietal denominations,</p>
