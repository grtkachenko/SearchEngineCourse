      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 602/98 of 9 March 1998 extending the coverage of Regulations (EC) No 3281/94 and No 1256/96 concerning Community schemes of generalised tariff preferences for the benefit of the least-developed countries</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 of 19 December 1994 applying a four-year scheme of generalised tariff preferences (1995 to 1998) in respect of certain industrial products originating in developing countries (1) provides for more favourable tariff treatment for the least-developed countries;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1256/96 of 20 June 1996 applying multiannual schemes of generalised tariff preferences from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1999 in respect of certain agricultural products originating in developing countries (2) likewise provides for more favourable tariff treatment for the least-developed countries;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas at the Singapore ministerial conference in December 1996 the World Trade Organisation (WTO) member countries pledged to carry out an action plan to improve access to their markets for products originating in the least-developed countries;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas on 2 June 1997 the Council, on the basis of a Commission communication of 16 April 1997, adopted conclusions calling for the implementation of the Singapore conclusions in particular by granting least-developed countries not party to the Fourth ACP-EC Convention preferences equivalent to those enjoyed by signatories to that Convention;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas equivalent treatment for industrial products means including the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) scheme all products currently excluded from it but exempt from customs duties under the Fourth ACP-EC Convention;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas agricultural products subject under the Fourth ACP-EC Convention to a tariff reduction but not to a tariff quota should be included in the scheme for the benefit of least-developed countries by applying one of the preferential rates of duty provided for in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1256/96, in line with the reduction accorded by the Fourth ACP-EC Convention,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="14">Access to the arrangements provided for in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 is hereby extended to the products listed in Annex I to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="15">Article 2</p>
      <p n="16">The arrangements laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1256/96 shall be supplemented by applying to the products listed in Annex II to this Regulation one of the preferential rates of duty specified in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1256/96, according to product sensitivity.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 3</p>

      <p n="23">It shall apply from 1 January 1998.</p>
      <p n="24">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
