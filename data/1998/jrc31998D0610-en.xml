      <p n="5">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, in order to achieve greater transparency in the Community's research and technological development policy and to enable it to play a more strategic role, the Commission wishes to involve all research workers (including users) more closely in its policy making;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas expert groups should therefore be set up to advise the Commission on the content and orientation of the key actions covered by the Council decisions on the specific programmes implementing the fifth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (1) and the fifth framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for research and training activities (2) (hereinafter 'the specific programmes`); whereas, under the Decision, these key actions must, where appropriate, be grouped together for reasons relating to the nature of the topics covered;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, in this connection, the role of the expert groups is to help define the overall strategy to be followed in carrying out the key actions or clusters of key actions and to deliver relevant conclusions in a completely transparent manner;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in view of the nature of the work, the members of these groups should be eminent persons, chosen from a wide range of applicants and appropriately qualified for the work in question;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, furthermore, the composition of these expert groups should be representative of all those involved in research; whereas efforts should therefore be made to ensure a balanced participation of women and men;</p>
