      <p n="2">COUNCIL DECISION of 3 December 1998 on common standards relating to filling in the uniform format for residence permits (98/701/JHA)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>

      <p n="5">Whereas it is necessary to establish common standards relating to filling in the said format, so as to ensure the uniform aspect thereof;</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas this Decision does not affect the competence of Member States relating to the recognition of States and territorial entities, as well as of passports and travel documents issued by these States or entities; whereas the attribution of the codes in the Appendix to this Decision is of a purely administrative nature and is without prejudice to the determination of the nationality of third country residents,</p>
      <p n="7">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="8">Article 1</p>
      <p n="9">The uniform format for residence permits shall be filled in in accordance with the procedures contained in the Annex hereto.</p>
      <p n="10">Article 2</p>
      <p n="11">The Council shall examine, at least once a year, the procedures and codes contained in the Annex and the Appendix hereto with a view to adapting them.</p>
      <p n="12">Article 3</p>
      <p n="13">This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="14">Done at Brussels, 3 December 1998.</p>
      <p n="15">For the Council</p>

      <p n="19">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="20">I. PROCEDURES FOR COMPLETION OF THE COMMON REFERENCE AREA OF THE STICKER IN THE UNIFORM FORMAT OF THE RESIDENCE PERMIT.</p>
      <p n="21">The format adopted for the sticker is in ID2 format (conforming with the dimensions for the ID2 type card (ISO7810)).</p>
      <p n="22">There are eight spaces to be completed in accordance with the technical specifications, where appropriate, as follows:</p>
      <p n="23">1. Permit No</p>
      <p n="24">The number of the document shall appear in this space (protected by special security features and preceded by a letter code), in accordance with part one paragraph 3.7 (initial letter(s) as detailed in paragraph 3.2) of the technical specifications.</p>
      <p n="25">2. Name</p>
      <p n="26">The surname(s) and first name(s) shall be inserted here in order. The surname(s) and first name(s) on the document to which the sticker is attached must be exactly the same as those on the sticker.</p>
      <p n="27">3. 'Valid until` space</p>
      <p n="28">The relevant date of expiry shall be entered in this space or, if necessary, a word or a code indicating unlimited validity.</p>
      <p n="29">Member States shall forward to the General Secretariat of the Council the various words or codes referred to in the previous subparagraph, to enable the Secretariat to draw up a list for distribution to all Member States. Such a list could also be used as an additional device for discovering falsifications.</p>
      <p n="30">Where an expiry date is entered, the date must be entered by means of three groups of two figures in the following order, two for the day, two for the month and two for the year, to be separated by a hyphen, and the first figure shall be a nought where the number is lower than 10 (e.g. 15-01-96: 15 January 1996).</p>

      <p n="41">Where necessary, the issuing authority may affix here its signature and its stamp and/or require the holder to affix his signature.</p>

      <p n="44">It is also desirable that the stamp consist of a rectangle 1 cm high × 2,5 cm wide showing the name of the authority issuing the residence permit and the signature and/or the date. The signature and/or the date should be framed on each side by three parallel horizontal lines, the middle one being half as long as the other two.</p>

On the second line, either the number of the permit or the passport number shall be recorded. The three codes relating to the nationality or status of the permit holder shall be entered in accordance with the list in the Appendix.</p>
