      <head n="1">Council Directive 98/20/EC of 30 March 1998 amending Directive 92/14/EEC on the limitation of the operation of aeroplanes covered by Part II, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition (1988)</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 98/20/EC of 30 March 1998 amending Directive 92/14/EEC on the limitation of the operation of aeroplanes covered by Part II, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition (1988)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 84(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),</p>
      <p n="8">(1) Whereas the main purpose of the provisions under Directive 92/14/EEC (4) is to restrict the operation of certain types of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes;</p>
      <p n="9">(2) Whereas a definition of the key elements of the Directive should prevent any ambiguity as to the objective and the scope of the Directive;</p>
      <p n="10">(3) Whereas this Directive does not deprive an individual Member State of the possibility of having recourse to the relevant provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes (5) in accordance with their terms;</p>
      <p n="11">(4) Whereas, due to the exceptional historical situation of the airports serving the Berlin conurbation and the location of the airports of Berlin Tegel and Berlin Tempelhof close to the city centre, it is justified to exempt temporarily these two airports from the application of certain provisions of Directive 92/14/EEC;</p>
      <p n="12">(5) Whereas it is necessary to respect the initial intention of the exemption for aeroplanes on the registers of developing nations; whereas the relevant provisions of the said Directive should therefore be clarified to that effect;</p>
      <p n="13">(6) Whereas an exemption granted for an aeroplane from a developing nation should benefit only that nation;</p>
      <p n="14">(7) Whereas it is necessary to clarify the scope for exemptions granted on economic grounds;</p>
      <p n="15">(8) Whereas it should be made clear that a Member State can only establish a timetable for the gradual withdrawal of non-compliant aeroplanes in respect of aeroplanes which are on the register of that Member State;</p>
      <p n="16">(9) Whereas some Member States have agreements with third country carriers allowing them an exemption for phasing out Chapter 2 aeroplanes similar to that granted to Community air carriers; whereas it is appropriate that these agreements should not be revoked;</p>
      <p n="17">(10) Whereas it is essential that the Annex to Directive 92/14/EEC be kept up to date and amended in a timely manner; whereas, therefore, amendments should be drawn up by the Commission assisted by a committee of a regulatory nature;</p>
      <p n="18">(11) Whereas Article 3 of Directive 92/14/EEC provides for exemptions for aeroplanes on the registers of developing nations and whereas the aeroplanes so exempted were listed in the Annex to that Directive;</p>
      <p n="19">(12) Whereas it is necessary to amend the Annex to Directive 92/14/EEC so as to add certain aeroplanes which qualify for an exemption and were not included when that Directive was adopted; whereas it is also necessary to delete all mention of certain aeroplanes that have been withdrawn from service, destroyed or otherwise no longer qualify for the exemption;</p>
      <p n="20">(13) Whereas it is essential to prevent wrong usage of registrations; whereas the Annex to this Directive contains, for each aeroplane, reference to the manufacturers' serial number for the individual aeroplane;</p>
      <p n="21">(14) Whereas it is important to ensure that infringements of Community law are penalised under conditions which make the penalty effective, proportionate and dissuasive;</p>
      <p n="22">(15) Whereas under the 1994 Act of Accession Austria has to comply with the provisions of Directive 92/14/EEC as from 1 April 2002,</p>
      <p n="23">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="24">Article 1</p>
      <p n="25">Amendments</p>

      <p n="31">"Community air carrier" means an air carrier with a valid operating licence granted by a Member State in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on licensing of air carriers (*);</p>
      <p n="32">"total civil subsonic jet fleet" means the total aircraft fleet of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes at the disposal of the air carrier, through ownership or any form of lease agreement of not less than one year.</p>
      <p n="33">(*) OJ L 240, 24.8.1992, p. 1.`;</p>
      <p n="34">2. the following paragraph shall be added to Article 2:</p>
      <p n="35">'4. Before the date referred to in paragraph 2, the operation of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes which do not comply with the provision of paragraph 1(a) may be restricted or excluded at the airports of Berlin Tegel and Berlin Tempelhof.`;</p>
      <p n="36">3. Article 3(b) shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="37">'(b) these aeroplanes were on the register of the developing nation shown for that aeroplane in the Annex in the reference year and continue to be used either directly or under any form of lease agreement by natural or legal persons established in that nation.`;</p>
      <p n="38">4. the following subparagraph shall be added to Article 3:</p>
      <p n="39">'The exemption referred to in the preceding subparagraph shall not apply where the aeroplane is leased to a natural or legal person established in a country other than the one mentioned for that aeroplane in the Annex.`;</p>
      <p n="40">5. in Article 4, Article 5(c) and (d) and Article 6 'airline` shall be replaced by 'air carrier`;</p>
      <p n="41">6. Article 7 shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="42">'Article 7</p>
      <p n="43">1. Member States may limit deletion from their registers of all mention of aeroplanes which do not comply with the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16 to an equivalent annual rate of up to 10 % of the total civil subsonic jet fleet of a Community air carrier.</p>
      <p n="44">2. Member States shall not apply the provisions of Article 2(1) in respect of aeroplanes retained on the register of a Member State in accordance with paragraph 1.</p>
      <p n="45">3. Where a Member State has applied an equivalent exemption to that described in paragraphs 1 and 2 to aeroplanes on the register of a third country and operating into that Member State before this Directive enters into force, the exemption may continue to be recognised subject to compliance by the air carrier with the conditions.`;</p>
      <p n="46">7. the following Articles shall be inserted:</p>
      <p n="47">'Article 9a</p>
      <p n="48">Amendments to the Annex which may prove necessary in order to ensure full conformity with the criteria set out in Article 3 shall be effected according to the procedure defined in Article 9b(2).</p>

The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter.

      <p n="53">(b) If the measures envisaged are not in accordance with the opinion of the committee, or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken. The Council shall act by a qualified majority.</p>
      <p n="54">If the Council has not acted within three months of the date of the referral to it, the Commission shall adopt the measures proposed.</p>
