      <p n="2">EXCHANGE OF LETTERS between the Community and Ukraine in relation to the establishment of companies</p>
      <p n="3">A. Letter from Ukraine</p>
      <p n="4">Dear Sir</p>
      <p n="5">I refer to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement initialled on 23 March 1994.</p>
      <p n="6">As I underlined during the negotiations, Ukraine grants to Community companies establishing and operating in Ukraine in certain respects a privileged treatment. I explained that this reflects Ukrainian policy to promote, by all means, the establishment of Community companies in Ukraine.</p>
      <p n="7">With this in mind, it is my understanding that during the period between the date of initialling of this Agreement and the entry into force of the relevant Articles on establishment of companies, Ukraine shall not adopt measures or regulations which would introduce or worsen discrimination of Community companies vis-à-vis Ukrainian companies or companies from any third country as compared to the situation existing on the date of initialling of this Agreement.</p>
      <p n="8">I would be obliged if you could acknowledge receipt of this letter.</p>
      <p n="9">Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.</p>
      <p n="10">For the Government of Ukraine</p>
