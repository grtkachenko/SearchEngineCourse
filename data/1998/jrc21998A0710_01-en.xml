      <p n="183">ANNEX II</p>
      <p n="184">1. Introduction</p>
      <p n="185">This Annex provides a breakdown of the contributions of the Parties referred to in Article 4. They are related to the design, development and implementation of EGNOS up to the completion of a first implementation phase involving the use of at least two geostationary navigation transponders. A description of EGNOS is given below.</p>
      <p n="186">The EGNOS system is an augmentation of existing satellite-based radio-navigation and positioning systems using geostationary satellites that will enhance the performance of these systems over Europe and more generally over the whole geostationary broadcast area(s).</p>
      <p n="187">By using navigation transponders on geostationary satellites and processing data from a network of terrestrial monitoring stations, EGNOS shall provide additional satellite ranging capability, service integrity and wide area differential (WAD) correction data. The aim of the WAD service is to improve the accuracy of existing satellite-based radio-navigation systems, in particular over Europe. The EGNOS system will improve the overall satellite navigation service availability.</p>
      <p n="188">The EGNOS infrastructure will consist of:</p>
      <p n="189">- mission control centres (MCCs),</p>
      <p n="190">- navigation transponders on geostationary satellites,</p>
      <p n="191">- navigation land earth stations (NLESs) for accessing the navigation transponders,</p>
      <p n="192">- ranging and integrity monitoring stations (RIMSs),</p>
      <p n="193">- upgraded RIMSs for accurate orbit determination of the geostationary satellites hosting the navigation transponders,</p>
      <p n="194">- a network of reference stations for verifying the integrity of the WAD corrections computed by EGNOS. Simplified RIMSs will be used as reference stations.</p>
      <p n="195">2. ESA contribution</p>
      <p n="196">ESA shall contribute through the implementation of its ARTES programme, in particular Element 9 thereof.</p>
      <p n="197">In particular, ESA shall undertake the following activities:</p>
      <p n="198">- EGNOS project management,</p>
      <p n="199">- mission analysis and system definition,</p>
      <p n="200">- early trials,</p>
      <p n="201">- test and simulation,</p>
      <p n="202">- ranging-system development,</p>
      <p n="203">- integrity-system development,</p>
      <p n="204">- WAD system development,</p>
      <p n="205">- testing and technical validation of EGNOS, including provisions for ground communications and MCCs running costs during the testing and validation period.</p>
      <p n="206">3. Eurocontrol contribution</p>
      <p n="207">Eurocontrol shall undertake, in the context of its satellite navigation applications activities and in close cooperation with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the following:</p>
      <p n="208">- provision of civil aviation user requirements,</p>
      <p n="209">- operational testing and validation for civil aviation GNSS 1 users. This will include static ground measurements, dedicated flight trials and data recording campaigns on commercial airliners,</p>
      <p n="210">- support to the European activities to ensure that GNSS is operationally acceptable for civil aviation. This work shall be carried out with the widest cooperation possible within the civil aviation environment, including the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA).</p>
      <p n="211">4. Community contribution</p>
      <p n="212">The Community shall undertake, in accordance with its relevant procedures in the context of the Trans-European Network and the framework programmes on research and development, to contribute to the following tasks:</p>
      <p n="213">- consolidation of user requirements relative to GNSS 1,</p>
      <p n="214">- design, development and support of the standardization effort of GNSS 1 user equipment, for all types of application (maritime, civil aviation, land transport),</p>
      <p n="215">- analysis of the integration aspects in the user vehicles, in preparation of validation trials,</p>
      <p n="216">- provision of at least two satellite links for the implementation of EGNOS (in particular lease of AOR-E and IOR Inmarsat III transponders and of necessary facilities in corresponding NLESs),</p>
      <p n="217">- performance of trials in operational conditions to validate user requirements and user equipment prototypes.</p>
