      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 of 12 October 1993 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 339/98 (2), and in particular Article 19 in conjunction with Article 17 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, some errors in the Customs Nomenclature for category 76 have occurred in the last updating of Annex I (list of textile products), which need to be corrected;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the Council has decided by Decision of 18 December 1997 (3) to apply on a provisional basis additional protocols to the Free Trade and Europe Agreements with the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania concerning trade in textiles;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the Council has decided by Decision of 18 December 1997 (4) to apply on a provisional basis the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters amending the agreement between the European Community and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam on trade in textile and clothing products initialled on 15 December 1992, as last amended by the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters initialled on 1 August 1995;</p>

      <p n="12">Whereas all the above elements make it necessary to amend the relevant portions of Annexes I, II, III, V, VII, VIII and IX to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 to take into account the changes introduced applicable on the importation into the Community of certain textile products originating in certain third countries within the meaning of Article 19 of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93;</p>
