      <p n="7">Whereas, in the absence of fresh scientific data, in particular as regards long-term toxicity, the Scientific Committee on Cosmetology recommends that the use of moskene and musk tibetene should be prohibited in cosmetic products as they may present a risk to the health of consumers;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas a further toxicological evaluation of strontium chloride, based on new data submitted by industry, shows that the use of this substance may be extended, without any safety risk, to shampoos and face care products provided a maximum concentration is not exceeded;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, on the basis of the latest scientific data, the use may be permitted of benzalkonium chloride, bromide and saccharinate as preservatives in cosmetic products subject to the requirements of the Directive;</p>

      <p n="11">Whereas, on the basis of the latest scientific data, phenol 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4-methyl-6-(2-methyl-3-(1,3,3,3-tetramethyl-1-(trimethylsilyl)oxy)-disiloxanyl)propyl) may be used as a UV filter in cosmetic products subject to the requirements of the Directive;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, on the basis of the latest scientific data, benzoic acid,4,4-((6-(((1,1-dimethylethyl)amino)carbonyl)phenyl)amino) 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diyl)diamino)bis-,bis(2-ethylhexyl)ester may be used as a UV filter in cosmetic products;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, on the basis of the latest scientific research and data, ethoxylated ethyl-4-aminobenzoate, isopentyl-4-methoxycinnamate, 2,4,6-trianilino-(p-carbo-2'-ethylhexyl-1'oxy)-1,3,5-triazine and 2-Ethylhexyl salicylate may be used as UV filters in cosmetic products subject to the requirements of the Directive;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, on the basis of the latest scientific research and data, 3-(4'-methylbenzylidene)-d-1camphor and 3-benzylidene camphor may be used as UV filters in cosmetic products;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the measures laid down in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives on the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Cosmetic Products Sector,</p>
