      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2334/98 of 29 October 1998 laying down special measures derogating from Regulations (EEC) No 3665/87, (EEC) No 3719/88 and (EC) No 1372/95 as regards poultrymeat</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2916/95 (2), and in particular Articles 8(12) and 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2026/83 (4), lays down general rules on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3665/87 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 604/98 (6), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1044/98 (8), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1372/95 (9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1009/98 (10), lays down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the poultry sector;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the problems prevailing on the market in Russia since the second half of August 1998 have seriously damaged the economic interests of exporters and whereas the situation thus created has adversely affected export possibilities provided for in Regulations (EEC) No 565/80, (EEC) No 3665/87 and (EEC) No 3719/88;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas it is accordingly necessary to limit such damaging consequences by adopting special measures and extending certain time limits laid down in the Regulations applicable to refunds so that export operations which have not been completed on account of the abovementioned circumstances can be regularised;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas only those operators who can prove, in particular on the basis of the documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 (11), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3235/94 (12), that the licences were requested with a view to exports to Russia should benefit from the derogations;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, in the light of developments, this Regulation should enter into force immediately and should be applicable from 1 August 1998;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Eggs and Poultrymeat,</p>
