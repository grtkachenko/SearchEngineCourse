      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 20/98 of 7 January 1998 laying down rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards aid to producer organizations granted preliminary recognition</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 20/98 of 7 January 1998 laying down rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards aid to producer organizations granted preliminary recognition</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2520/97 (2), and in particular Article 48 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 states that new producer organizations or those which have not been recognized under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 (3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1363/95 (4), may be allowed a transitional period of no more than five years in which to meet the conditions for recognition laid down in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96; whereas Regulation (EC) No 478/97 (5) establishes the conditions for granting preliminary recognition to producer organizations;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, in order to encourage the formation of producer organizations, Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 also states that Member States may grant two sorts of aid to producer organizations granted preliminary recognition in the five years following such preliminary recognition, one to cover the costs of their formation and administrative operation and one to cover part of the investments required to attain recognition and set out in their recognition plans;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, to facilitate the correct application of the system of aid to cover the costs of formation and administrative operation, that aid should be granted at a flat rate; whereas that flat-rate aid should be subject to a ceiling in order to comply with budgetary constraints; whereas, to take account of the differing financial needs of producer organizations of different sizes, that ceiling should be adjusted in line with the marketable production of the producer organizations; whereas, since the rules contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2118/78 (6) are no longer applicable, that Regulation should accordingly be repealed;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the selection criteria laid down by the Commission pursuant to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 951/97 of 20 May 1997 on improving the processing and marketing conditions for agricultural products (7) should be applied to investments eligible under this Regulation in order to ensure consistency between the various measures financed by the Community, until such time as the new agricultural policy guidelines for fruit and vegetables introduced by Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 are implemented;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the aid provided for in this Regulation should be discontinued once the producer organization is recognized by the Member State; whereas, however, to take account of the multiannual financing of investments, those qualifying for investment aid under this Regulation can be carried over to operational programmes as referred to in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, in the event of mergers, the aid may continue to be granted to the producer organizations resulting from the merger;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, in order to ensure that the aid provided for in this Regulation is applied properly, the Member State in question should check that the grant of the aid is duly justified, account being taken of any previous grants of aid for the launching of producer organizations and of any movements of producers between producer organizations; whereas the Member States must also ensure that duplicate Community or national financing is not granted for measures qualifying for Community financing under this Regulation;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas procedures should be laid down for controls and penalties;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas Article 14 (7) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides a special scheme for Portugal; whereas provisions should be laid down to ensure compliance with that special scheme;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the Management Committee for fresh Fruit and Vegetables has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>

Aid as provided for in Article 14 (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 shall be granted, directly or through credit institutions, in the form of special loans to cover part of the cost of investments linked to implementation of the measures in recognition plans as described in Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 478/97.</p>
      <p n="43">Investments liable to distort competition where the other economic activities of the organization are concerned and investments not satisfying the selection criteria adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 8 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 951/97 shall be excluded.</p>
      <p n="44">2. Investments to the direct or indirect benefit of such activities shall be financed pro rata to their use for the sectors or products for which preliminary recognition is granted.</p>
      <p n="45">Article 4</p>

      <p n="48">3. Investments qualifying for the aid for the costs referred to in Article 3 may be carried over to operational programmes provided they are in line with Regulation (EC) No 411/97.</p>
      <p n="49">Article 5</p>

Applications for reimbursement of the aid to meet the costs referred to in Articles 2 and 3 and relating to expenditure paid by the Member State to all the organizations concerned during the course of a calendar year shall be submitted to the Commission in a single batch not later than 30 June of the following year.</p>
      <p n="51">2. All applications for aid shall be accompanied by a written declaration from the organization to the effect that the latter:</p>
      <p n="52">- complies, and will comply, with the provisions of Regulations (EC) No 2200/96 and (EC) No 478/97 and this Regulation,</p>
      <p n="53">- does not benefit and has not benefited directly or indirectly from duplicate Community or national financing for measures for which Community financing is granted pursuant to this Regulation.</p>

Aid as provided for in Articles 2 and 3 of this Regulation may be given, or may continue to be given, to producer organizations which have been granted preliminary recognition under Regulation (EC) No 478/97 and which result from the merger between a producer organization granted preliminary recognition under that Regulation and one or more of the following:</p>

      <p n="60">Article 7</p>
      <p n="61">Member States shall evaluate the eligibility of producer organizations for the aid under this Regulation in order to establish that the aid is duly justified, regard being had to the conditions and the date on which any earlier public aid was granted to the producer organizations from which the members of the producer organizations in question originate, and to any movements of members between producer organizations.</p>

      <p n="82">- the value of marketed production is less than the amount used for the calculation of the Community's financial assistance, or</p>
      <p n="83">- aid covered by this Regulation has not been used in accordance with the regulations applicable or with the approved recognition plan,</p>
      <p n="84">the recipient shall be required to reimburse double the amount unduly paid, plus interest for the period between payment and reimbursement.</p>
