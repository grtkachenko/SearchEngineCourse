      <p n="6">Whereas this Directive has laid down rules in respect of conditions for approving and registering these establishments located in the Community; whereas equivalent provisions for approving and registering establishments located in third countries must be adopted;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the choice of these countries must be based on criteria of a general nature such as the rules in force in the field of production of feedingstuffs and the organisation and powers of the competent authority responsible for the controls in this field;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas it must be ensured that these establishments located in third countries meet at least equivalent conditions to those laid down for the establishments located in the Member States, in order to ensure that the products deriving from them do not pose risks for human or animal health or the environment;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the possibility that experts from the Commission and the Member States verify in third countries the respect of the rules laid down by the present Directive must be foreseen;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the list of third countries and of their establishments will be made the subject of further implementing Decisions;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas it is necessary, in order not to interrupt the trade with third countries, to have transitional arrangements for the changeover from the old to the new import authorisation system, pending the full functioning of the new regime;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, pending the adoption of the lists of establishments located in third countries, Member States should send the Commission and the other Member States the information concerning the establishments located in third countries authorised to put products into circulation within the Community which have a representative located on their territory;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas uniform arrangements should be adopted to define a model both for the register of approved establishments and intermediaries and for the list of registered establishments and intermediaries;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas uniform arrangements should be adopted to define the structure both for the approval number and for the registration number of the establishments and intermediaries;</p>
