      <p n="2">COMMISSION DECISION of 15 December 1997 amending for the fourth time Council Directive 82/894/EEC on the notification of animal diseases within the Community and temporarily amending the frequency of notification for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Text with EEA relevance) (98/12/EC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 82/894/EEC of 21 December 1982 on the notification of animal diseases within the Community (1), as last amended by Commission Decision 92/450/EEC (2), and in particular Article 5 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy continue within Community territory; whereas that disease should accordingly be kept on the list of diseases notifiable under Directive 82/894/EEC;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, in the light of experience gained, the requirement to notify outbreaks of that disease should be extended; whereas, as a derogation until 31 December 2002, weekly reporting of outbreaks containing the information normally required for secondary outbreaks appears sufficient;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas provisions adopted previously concerning notification of the disease should be repealed;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>

      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">By way of a derogation from Article 3 (1) of Directive 82/894/EEC, all outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy shall be notified until 31 December 2002 in accordance with Article 4 of that Directive.</p>
      <p n="15">Article 3</p>
      <p n="16">Decision 92/450/EEC is hereby repealed.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 4</p>
