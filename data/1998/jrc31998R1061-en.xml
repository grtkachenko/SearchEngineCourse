      <p n="6">Whereas Article 11 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 (3) lays down the time limit for processing and incorporating into final products the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation; whereas the length of the time limit is for the moment a factor encouraging speculative operations; whereas the time limit should therefore be reduced;</p>

      <p n="8">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,</p>
      <p n="9">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="10">Article 1</p>
      <p n="11">Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="12">1. in Article 11, 'six months` is replaced by 'three months`,</p>
      <p n="13">2. in Article 17(1), 'ECU 180` is replaced by 'ECU 350`.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
