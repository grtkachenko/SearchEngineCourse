      <p n="6">Whereas the Member States are contracting parties to the Customs Convention on the ATA Carnet for the Temporary Admission of Goods (ATA Convention) done at Brussels on 6 December 1961; whereas the Community is not a contracting party to that Convention, in the absence of a provision allowing it to accede thereto;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas a recommendation for an amendment to the said Convention was adopted on the initiative of certain Member States at the first meeting of the contracting parties held on 26 November 1987 and whereas the amendment concerned the Annex thereto containing the model of the ATA carnet; whereas the Secretary-General of the Customs Cooperation Council notified the contracting parties of this recommendation on 4 November 1988;</p>
