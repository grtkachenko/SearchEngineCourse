      <p n="9">Whereas the curing time of certain salted products means that in some cases it is impossible to keep to the deadline for lodging applications for the payment of the allowance set in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3460/85 (3); whereas, in the interests of preventing the products concerned from being unable to qualify for the compensatory allowance, Article 5 (1) of the abovementioned Regulation should be amended;</p>

      <p n="14">'For salted products which must be cured in salt for a period which means that the six-month deadline referred to above cannot be adhered to, the Member State concerned extends, if necessary, this deadline to the extent required for the products to cure. This extension of the deadline can in no case be longer than six months.'</p>
      <p n="15">Article 2</p>
