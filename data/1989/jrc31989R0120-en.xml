      <p n="21">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 645/75 of the Commission (22), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3677/86 (23), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the export levies and charges on agricultural products; whereas experience has shown that new provisions should be introduced into that Regulation; whereas, for the sake of clarity and administratieve efficiency, the rules applying to the subject should accordingly be recast;</p>
      <p n="22">Whereas the export levies and charges form part of the export duties, as defined in particular in Article 1 (2) (e) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2144/87 of 13 July 1987 on customs debt (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 4108/88 (2);</p>
      <p n="23">Whereas export levies should not be applied to exports under a licence where the refund is fixed in advance or determined by tender;</p>
      <p n="24">Whereas certain transactions are of no economic significance or concern very small quantities; whereas such transactions may be exempted from the export levy;</p>
      <p n="25">Whereas it is necessary to specify the date to be taken into consideration for purposes of determining the rate of the export levy and also the Member State which is to collect the export levy;</p>
      <p n="26">Whereas, in order to avoid speculative transactions, measures should be taken to ensure that products for which the export declaration has been accepted leave the customs territory of the Community within a reasonable time; whereas the 60-day period laid down for exports qualifying for refunds may also be applied where an export levy is collected; whereas, where that period is exceeded, special provisions must be laid down, in the particular case of export levies, to determine the rates thereof;</p>
      <p n="27">Whereas the task of customs authorities is made easier if products to which an export levy has been applied move under a procedure which is different from that used for products to which an export levy is not applied; whereas, to that end, it should be provided that products to which an export levy has been applied move under the external Community transit procedure;</p>
      <p n="28">Whereas, where the products concerned leave the Community territory during carriage from one point to another of the latter, appropriate provisions should be laid down to recover the export levy in question where products are not re-introduced into the Community; whereas to that end Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1062/87 of 27 March 1987 on provisions for the implementation of the Community transit procedure and for certain simplifications of that procedure (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1469/88 (4), should be applied;</p>
      <p n="29">Whereas export licences without advance fixing of the refund may have been applied for or issued before the date of application of the export levy; whereas, apart from cases of advance fixing, the export of agricultural products should not be required where an export levy is applied; whereas, consequently, it should be provided that such applications for licences may be withdrawn or such licences may be cancelled at the request of the party concerned, with the security lodged being released;</p>
      <p n="30">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the relevant management committees,</p>

      <p n="32">Article 1</p>

      <p n="42">Article 2</p>
      <p n="43">Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation, export levies shall apply to all exports, permanent or temporary, to a destination outside the customs territory of the Community of:</p>
      <p n="44">(a) products which come under Article 9 (2) of the Treaty, whether or not their packaging comes under that provision;</p>

      <p n="46">Article 3</p>
      <p n="47">1. No export levies shall be chargeable on exports in respect of which a refund has been fixed in advance or determined by a tendering procedure.</p>
      <p n="48">Where in the case of a compound product a refund is fixed in advance in respect of one or more of its components, within the meaning of Article 8 (3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3665/87 (1), exemption from export levies shall apply only in respect of such component or components.</p>
      <p n="49">2. In addition to the cases referred to in Chapter II of Council Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 (2), no export levies shall be chargeable on:</p>

      <p n="58">1. Except where the export levy is fixed in advance or determined under a tendering procedure, the levy rate applicable shall be that in force on the date on which the customs authority accepts the export declaration relating to the products on which export levies are chargeable. From the time of such acceptance the products shall remain under customs control until they leave the customs territory of the Community.</p>

      <p n="62">the export levy rate chargeable shall be the highest of the rates in force during the period from the date of acceptance of the export declaration to the date on which the products leave the customs territory of the Community; where a rate fixed in advance higher than the highest rate was applicable that rate shall be chargeable.</p>

Where such proof is not furnished within a period of 12 months from the date on which the export declaration was accepted, the date of exit from the Community's customs territory shall be regarded as being the last day of that period.</p>

      <p n="70">Article 5</p>
      <p n="71">1. The export levy shall be collected by the Member State to which the customs office which accepts the export declaration belongs.</p>

      <p n="74">(b) where such security is given, the exporter must, save in case of force majeure, furnish proof, within 12 months from the date of acceptance, that the product has been imported; such proof shall be furnished in the manner provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 3665/87;</p>
      <p n="75">(c) where the proof referred to in (b) is not furnished within the prescribed period the products shall be regarded, save in case of force majeure, as having reached the destination in respect of which the highest levy rate is chargeable, and the security shall be forfeited and treated as an export levy;</p>
      <p n="76">(d) where the proof referred to in (b) is furnished within the prescribed period, the security shall be released according to the destination which the product has reached and in proportion to the quantities in respect of which such proof is furnished; any amount of the security not released shall be forfeited and treated as an export levy;</p>

      <p n="79">3. Where the period referred to in 2 (b), (c) and (e) has not been complied with although the exporter has endeavoured to obtain the proof in time, that period may, at the exporter's request, be extended for such term as the competent authority of the exporting Member State considers necessary in view of the circumstances invoked.</p>
      <p n="80">Article 6</p>
      <p n="81">Where the proof referred to in the fourth subparagraph of Article 4 (1) and/or the proof referred to in Article 5 (2) (b) are furnished within six months of the expiry of the period laid down in those Articles, the amount due by way of levy shall be:</p>
      <p n="82">(a) the levy which would have been collected if the said period had been complied with;</p>
      <p n="83">(b) plus 15 % of the difference between the levy collected and the amount referred to at (a).</p>
      <p n="84">Article 7</p>
      <p n="85">Once the export declaration lodged in respect of products as referred to in Article 2 (a) has been accepted, the latter shall be deemed no longer to be covered by Article 9 (2) of the Treaty and shall accordingly move in accordance with Article 1 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 222/77 (1) on Community transit.</p>

      <p n="89">(a) where an internal Community transit document giving an office belonging to a Member State as the office of destination does not contain the entry referred to in Article 21 of Regulation (EEC) No 1062/87 (second entry) because the product concerned was not subject to an export levy when the internal Community transit declaration was authenticated; and</p>
      <p n="90">(b) where, under the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the EFTA countries on common transit arrangements that product is presented at an office in an EFTA country; and</p>

      <p n="92">3. If the exporter shows to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the goods left the customs territory of the Community on a date when no export levy or a levy lower than that mentioned in paragraph 2 was applicable, no levy or, where appropriate, the lower levy shall be collected.</p>
      <p n="93">4. For the purposes of this Regulation the EFTA countries are Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.</p>
      <p n="94">Article 9</p>

A security shall be lodged in accordance with Article 24 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1062/77 in respect of products moving as provided for in Articles 24 and 25 of that Regulation to ensure that the export levy payable is charged if such products do not re-enter the customs territory of the Community.</p>
      <p n="96">2. As soon as proof is furnished in the Member State of departure that the products have re-entered the customs territory of the Community, the security shall be released in proportion to the quantities in respect of which such proof is furnished.</p>

      <p n="99">territory of the Community, the office of departure may not authorize any variation of the contract of carriage which would enable carriage to end outside the said customs territory unless it has taken the necessary steps to ensure that the export levy payable is charged. In such cases, the export levy rate applicable shall be that in force on the date on which the declaration of export to third countries is accepted by the office of departure.</p>
      <p n="100">Article 11</p>
      <p n="101">1. Where an export levy is in force and products are re-exported under the second subparagraph of Article 6 (2) or the second subparagraph of Article 11 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1430/79 (1), a security equal to the export levy shall be lodged.</p>
