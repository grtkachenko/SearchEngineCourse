      <p n="10">Whereas there is an analogy between the costs in question and those resulting from application of Article 40 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and whereas, therefore, the same rules as those laid down in Articles 3 and 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3247/81 may be applied;</p>

      <p n="15">a. revenue deriving from sales of the alcohol;</p>
      <p n="16">b. the value of quantitative losses exceeding the tolerance limit;</p>
      <p n="17">c. the value of quantities missing as a result of theft or other identifiable losses;</p>
      <p n="18">d. the value of quantities which have deteriorated as a result of storage conditions;</p>

      <p n="24">Article 3</p>
      <p n="25">The tolerance limit for losses of quantities admitted into storage of the products of the distillation operations referred to in Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall be that provided for in respect of the products of the distillation operations referred in Article 39 of the said Regulation.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 4</p>
      <p n="27">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="28">It shall apply with effect from 1 October 1987.</p>
      <p n="29">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
