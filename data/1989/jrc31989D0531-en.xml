      <p n="12">Whereas the reference laboratory will build up, store and supply when necessary to the national laboratories, diagnostic agents so that diagnosis in the said national laboratories is carried out in a uniform manner; whereas the reference laboratory must organize comparative trials, carry out further training of experts, and develop data and information systems for the use of the Commission and the Member States;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the reference laboratory must operate under conditions of strict disease security; whereas the laboratory will formulate guidelines for the said security in the respective national laboratories;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas in respect of the reference laboratory a contract will be drawn up providing for appropriate financial support from the general budget of the European Communities,</p>

      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">The functions and duties of the reference laboratory designated in Article 1 shall be:</p>
