      <p n="2">COMMISSION DECISION of 18 July 1989 laying down the criteria for approval and supervision of breeders' associations and breeding organizations which establish or maintain herd-books for pure-bred breeding pigs (89/501/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 88/661/EEC of 19 December 1988 on the zootechnical standards applicable to breeding animals of the porcine species (1), and in particular the fourth indent of Article 6 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas in all Member States herd-books are maintained or established by breeders' associations, breeding organizations or official services; whereas it is therefore necessary to lay down the criteria for the approval of breeders' associations and breeding organizations;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas breeders' associations or breeding organizations must apply for official approval to the competent authorities of the Member State on whose territory their headquarters are situated;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, where breeders' associations or breeding organizations meet certain criteria and have defined targets, they must be officially approved by the authorities of the Member State to which they have applied;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Zootechnics,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">In order to be officially approved, breeders' associations or breeding organizations which maintain or establish</p>
      <p n="13">herd-books must submit an application to the authorities of the Member State on whose territory their headquarters are situated.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">The authorities of the Member State concerned must grant official approval to any breeders' association or breeding organization which maintains or establishes herd-books if it meets the conditions laid down in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="16">However, in a Member State in which in respect of a given breed one or more officially-approved breeders' associations or breeding organizations already exist, the authorities of the Member State concerned may refuse to recognize a new breeders' association or breeding organization if it endangers the preservation of the breed or jeopardizes the zootechnical programme of the existing association or organization. In such a case, the Member State shall inform the Commission of approvals granted and refusals to give recognition.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 3</p>
      <p n="18">The authorities of the Member State concerned shall withdraw official approval from any breeders' association or breeding organization which maintains herd-books if the conditions laid down in the Annex are no longer being fulfilled in a persistent manner by the breeders' association or breeding organization concerned.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 4</p>
      <p n="20">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Done at Brussels, 18 July 1989.</p>
      <p n="22">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="23">Ray MAC SHARRY</p>
      <p n="24">Member of the Commission</p>

      <p n="26">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="27">In order to be officially approved, breeders' associations and breeding organizations which maintain or establish a herd-book must:</p>
      <p n="28">1. have legal personality in accordance with the legislation in force in the Member State where the application is made;</p>
      <p n="29">2. prove to the competent authorities:</p>
      <p n="30">(a) that they operate efficiently;</p>
      <p n="31">(b) that they can carry out the checks necessary for recording pedigrees;</p>
      <p n="32">(c) that they have a sufficiently large herd to carry out a breed improvement programme, or that they have a sufficiently large herd to preserve the breed where this is considered necessary;</p>
      <p n="33">(d) that they can make use of the livestock performance data necessary for carrying out their breed improvement or preservation programme;</p>
      <p n="34">3. have a set of rules covering:</p>
      <p n="35">(a) the definition of the breed's (or breeds') characteristics;</p>
      <p n="36">(b) the system for identifying animals;</p>
      <p n="37">(c) the system for recording pedigrees;</p>
      <p n="38">(d) the definition of their breeding objectives;</p>
      <p n="39">(e) the systems for making use of livestock performance data, enabling the genetic value of the animals to be assessed;</p>
      <p n="40">(f) the division of the herd-book, if there are different conditions for entering animals or if there are different procedures for classifying the animals entered in the book;</p>
      <p n="41">4. have articles of association, laying down, in particular, the principle of non-discrimination between members.</p>
