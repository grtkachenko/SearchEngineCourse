      <p n="3">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE</p>
      <p n="4">of 20 January 1989</p>
      <p n="5">amending Annex II to Council Directive 66/401/EEC on the marketing of fodder plant seed</p>
      <p n="6">(89/100/EEC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed (1), as last amended by Directive 88/380/EEC (2), and in particular Article 21a thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, by reason of the conditions of its cultivation and its morphological characteristics, seed of meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis) contains a relatively high proportion of seed of poa species;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, for seed of meadow foxtail, it is accordingly difficult to obtain, in relation to seed of poa species, the 1 % maximum content by weight of seeds or a single other plant species laid down in Annex II to Directive 66/401/EEC;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas for seed of tall oatgrass (Arrhenatherum elatius) and golden oatgrass (Trisetum flavescens), which display similar morphological characteristics, this 1 % maximum does not apply to seed of poa species;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, in the light of the development of technical knowledge, it is therefore appropriate to amend Annex II to Directive 66/401/EEC in order to make the same provision for seed of meadow foxtail;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">In Annex II to Directive 66/401/EEC, part I, section 2 (A) ('Table'), column 6 ('Analytical purity - Maximum content of seeds of other plant species (% by weight) - A single species'), after '1,0' given for Alopecurus pratensis, '(f)' is added.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 1 January 1990. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 3</p>
      <p n="21">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="22">Done at Brussels, 20 January 1989.</p>
      <p n="23">For the Commission</p>
