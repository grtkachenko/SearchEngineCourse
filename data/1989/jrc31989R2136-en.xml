      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 of 29 December 1981 on the common organization of the market in fishery products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1495/89 (2), and in particular Article 2 (3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 provides for the possibility of adopting common marketing standards for fishery products in the Community, particularly in order to keep products of unsatisfactory quality off the market and to facilitate trade relations based on fair competition;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the adoption of such standards for preserved sardines is likely to improve the profitability of sardine production in the Community, and the market outlets therefor, and to facilitate disposal of the products;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas it must be specified in this context, particularly in order to ensure market transparency, that the products concerned must be prepared exclusively with fish of the species ´Sardina pilchardus Walbaum' and must contain a minimum quantity of fish;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, in order to ensure good market presentation, the criteria for the preparation of the fish prior to packaging, the presentations in which it may be marketed and the covering media and additional ingredients which may be used should be laid down; whereas these criteria must not, however, be such as to preclude the introduction of new products on to the market;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, to prevent the marketing of unsatisfactory products, certain criteria which preserved sardines must satisfy in order to be marketed in the Community for human consumption should be defined;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States related to the labelling, presentation and advertising of</p>
      <p n="13">(3) OJ No L 379, 31. 12. 1981, p. 1.</p>

      <p n="15">foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer (5) as last amended by Directive 86/197/EEC (6) and Council</p>
      <p n="16">Directive 76/211/EEC of 20 January 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to making-up by weight or by volume of certain pre-packaged products (7) as last amended by Directive 78/891/EEC (8), specify the particulars required for correct information and protection of the consumer as regards the contents of packages; whereas, for preserved sardines, the trade description should be determined according to the culinary preparation proposed, having particular regard to the ratio between the various ingredients in the finished product; whereas, where the covering medium is oil, the way in which the oil must be described should be specified;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas the Commission should have responsibility for the adoption of any technical implementing measures,</p>
      <p n="18">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="19">Article 1 This Regulation defines the standards governing the marketing of preserved sardines in the Community.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2 Only products meeting the following requirements may be marketed as preserved sardines and under the trade description referred to in Article 7:</p>

      <p n="22">- they must be prepared exclusively from fish of the species ´Sardina pilchardus Walbaum';</p>
      <p n="23">- they must be pre-packaged with any appropriate covering medium in a hermetically sealed container;</p>
      <p n="24">- they must be sterilized by appropriate treatment.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 3 The sardines must, to the extent required for good market presentation, be appropriately trimmed of the head, gills,</p>

      <p n="36">5. sardine trunks: sardine portions adjacent to the head, measuring at least 3 cm in length, obtained from the basic product referred to in point 1 by making transverse cuts across the backbone;</p>
      <p n="37">6. any other form of presentation, on condition that it is clearly distinguished from the presentations defined in points 1 to 5.</p>
      <p n="38">Article 5 For the purposes of the trade description laid down in Article 7, a distinction shall be drawn between the following covering media, with or without the addition of other ingredients:</p>
