      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EEC) No 1225/89 of 3 May 1989 amending Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1225/89 of 3 May 1989 amending Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2210/88 (5), defines the concept of small producer of olive oil eligible for the special arrangements referred to in the said Article; whereas, in particular for reasons of good management, this definition should be reviewed;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Article 26 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC stipulates an intervention buying-in price for oil seeds of 94 % of the intervention price set by the Council for the marketing year; whereas the monthly increases are applicable to products bought in by intervention, as is the supplement for ´double zero' rape seed; whereas, if the maximum guaranteed quantities are exceeded, the buying-in price is to be adjusted by the same amount as the adjustment of the aid; whereas, for the sake of clarity, this provision should be made more precise;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the sale of rape and sunflower seed to intervention agencies should be exceptional; whereas concern for sound management of the market dictates that the sale of such seed to user undertakings should be encouraged; whereas sales by growers to intervention agencies should therefore be restricted;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas Article 25 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC sets the dates from which the monthly increases run; whereas, in the interests of greater flexibility, these dates should instead be set in the Regulation determining the monthly increases to be applied during the marketing year;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, in the interest of stability of commercial transactions, provision was made for advance fixing of</p>
      <p n="13">refunds on olive oil; whereas experience has however shown</p>
      <p n="14">that under certain circumstances, in particular, abnormal use of this facility by interested parties, there have been justifiable fears of difficulties on the market;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas to remedy such a situation it would have to be possible for measures to be taken rapidly; whereas the Commission should therefore be enabled to adopt such measures following consultation of the Management Committee or even, in urgent cases without waiting for it to meet,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1 Regulation No 136/66/EEC is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="18">1. In</p>
      <p n="19">- the second and sixth subparagraphs of Article 5 (1), and</p>
      <p n="20">- the first indent of Article 5 (2),</p>
      <p n="21">´300' is replaced by ´400'.</p>
      <p n="22">2. The following paragraph is added to Article 20:</p>
      <p n="23">´4. If examination of the market situation reveals difficulties stemming from application of the provisions on advance fixing of the refund, or if there is a risk of such difficulties arising, a decision may be taken under the procedure provided for in Article 38 to suspend application of these provisions for the shortest period absolutely necessary.</p>
      <p n="24">In cases of extreme urgency the Commission may, following examination of the situation on the basis of all the information available to it, decide to suspend advance fixing for a period that may not exceed three working days.</p>
      <p n="25">During periods of suspension, licence applications accompanied by applications for advance fixing may not be lodged.'</p>
      <p n="26">3. Article 24a (1) is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="27">´1. The target, intervention and intervention buying-in prices for "double zero'' rape seed shall be increased by a supplement.'</p>
      <p n="28">4. The first subparagraph of Article 25 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="29">´To enable sales to be staggered, the target prices, the intervention prices and the intervention buying-in prices shall be increased each month for a period to be determined of at least five months running from the</p>
      <p n="30">beginning of the fifth month of the marketing year for</p>
      <p n="31">rape seed and from the beginning of the fourth month of the marketing year for sunflower seed by the same amount for all three prices.'</p>
      <p n="32">5. The first subparagraph of Article 26 (1) is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="33">´Intervention agencies shall buy in from 1 November to 31 May and, with regard to sunflower seed offered for intervention in Spain and Portugal, from 1 August to 30 April, on terms laid down as provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3, seed of Community origin offered to them. The buying-in price shall be 94 % of the intervention price.</p>
      <p n="34">Where appropriate, it shall be subject to the monthly increases, to the supplement indicated in Article 24 a and to the adjustment indicated in Article 27a (4).'</p>
      <p n="35">Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="36">It shall apply from 1 July 1989 to rape seed, from 1 August 1989 to sunflower seed and from 1 November 1989 to olive oil.</p>
      <p n="37">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="38">Done at Brussels, 3 May 1989.</p>
      <p n="39">For the Council</p>
