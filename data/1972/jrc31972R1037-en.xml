      <p n="2">REGULATION (EEC) No 1037/72 OF THE COUNCIL of 18 May 1972 laying down general rules for granting and financing aid for hop producers</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/711 of 26 July 1971 on the common organization of the market in hops, and in particular Article 13 (3) thereof;</p>

      <p n="8">Whereas Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 provides for the granting of aid for hops produced in the Community ; whereas it is therefore necessary to lay down the general rules of application provided for in Article 13 of that Regulation;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas aid is necessary for administrative reasons to grant aid, in each Member State, solely for areas planted to hops in the territory of that State;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas aid is only granted in respect of registered areas planted to hops ; whereas, consequently, provision should be made for the introduction by the Member States, of a system of declarations and registration of such areas;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the system of aid cannot work properly without checks ensuring that the aid is only granted for areas which are planted to hops and which are harvested;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas it should be laid down that areas for which aid is requested must be planted to hops in accordance with normal practice;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas this aid entails expenditure ; whereas Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 states that regulations on the financing of the common agricultural policy are applicable to this aid ; whereas, consequently, it should be specified that this aid is to be financed pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70;</p>

      <p n="20">Article 3</p>
      <p n="21">1. Member States shall introduce a system of declarations and registration of areas planted to hops.</p>
      <p n="22">2. Member States shall arrange for the verification of: (a) the accuracy of declarations of areas planted to hops which are submitted by the producers,</p>
      <p n="23">(b) the areas harvested.</p>
      <p n="24">1 OJ No L 175, 4.8.1971, p. 1. 2 OJ No L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 13.</p>
      <p n="25">Producer groups shall not be appointed to carry out this verification.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 4</p>

      <p n="28">Article 5</p>
      <p n="29">1. The aid provided for in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 is an intervention within the meaning of Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70.</p>
      <p n="30">2. Expenditure on the aid referred to in paragraph 1 shall be equal to amounts paid under Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 and provisions pursuant thereto.</p>
      <p n="31">Article 6</p>
      <p n="32">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="33">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="34">Done at Brussels, 18 May 1972.</p>
      <p n="35">For the Council</p>
