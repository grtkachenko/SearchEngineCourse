      <p n="2">REGULATION (EEC) No 992/72 OF THE COMMISSION of 15 May 1972 amending Regulation No 172/66/EEC fixing coefficients of equivalence for olive oil</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC1 of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2727/71,2 and in particular Article 13 (4) thereof;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation No 162/66/EEC3 of 27 October 1966 on trade in oils and fats between the Community and Greece, and in particular Articles 3 (4) and 9 thereof;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Commission Regulation No 172/66/EEC4 of 5 November 1966, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2445/71,5 fixed coefficients of equivalence for the different varieties and qualities of unrefined olive oil;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the low level of production of "lampante" oil in the Community and in Spain, the main exporting country, has given rise, particularly in recent weeks, to a considerable increase in offer prices for this oil on the world and Community markets ; whereas on the other hand the high level of production of edible virgin oil in the Community has led to a fall in value of this quality which has been reflected in the price of oil of the same quality offered on the world market;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas for this reason there has been a considerable change in the differences between the offer prices of the various qualities of oil in relation to those taken into account when the coefficients of equivalence were last fixed ; whereas, to ensure correct application of the levy system, a new Annex containing suitable coefficients for the olive oil which is the subject of the offers concerned should be substituted for the Annex to the Regulation referred to above;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats;</p>
      <p n="11">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="12">Article 1</p>
      <p n="13">The Annex to this Regulation shall be substituted for the Annex to Regulation No 172/66/EEC.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="17">Done at Brussels, 15 May 1972.</p>
      <p n="18">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="19">The President 1 OJ No 172, 30.9.1966, p. 3025/66.</p>
