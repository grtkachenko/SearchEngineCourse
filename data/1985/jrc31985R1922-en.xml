      <p n="15">'1. The purchaser must, before withdrawing the oil, pay to the intervention agency the provisional amount of the selling price.</p>
      <p n="16">The provisional amount shall be calculated by multiplying the quantity indicated as contained in the lot by the price offered for the lot. As regards lampante oil and olive-residue oil, this price shall be adjusted, in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 11 (2), on the basis of the result of the acidity analysis referred to in that paragraph.'</p>
