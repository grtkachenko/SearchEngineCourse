      <p n="10">Whereas the Act of Accession provides for a system of lists of authorized vessels and for a system of notifying vessels movements and of notifying catches to the Commission, in addition to the provisions laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2057/82 of 29 June 1982 establishing certain control measures for fishing activities by vessels of Member States (1) as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1729/83 (2);</p>
