      <p n="11">Whereas Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1985/74 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1701/78 (4), provides that one of the periods for which a reference price should be fixed shall be that running from 1 December to 31 July of the following year;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas experience has indicated the need to subdivide this period into two parts; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1985/74 should therefore be amended;</p>

      <p n="20">- from 1 January to 31 July.'</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 August 1985.</p>
