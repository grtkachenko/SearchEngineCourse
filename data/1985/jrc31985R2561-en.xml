      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar market (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1482/85 (2), and in particular Article 26 (3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, Article 26 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides in particular that C sugar must be exported in the natural state; whereas the second subparagraph of Article 2 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2670/81 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1760/84 (4), allows for substitution by other sugar white or raw in the natural state of C sugar to be exported on payment of a flat-rate amount by the producer to compensate for any advantage resulting from such a substitution; whereas the supply situation of the refineries of raw sugar in the Community, in particular with regard to the forthcoming accession of Portugal and of its particular supply of raw sugar, requires a limitation of the ability to substitute C sugar on export to white sugar only;</p>
