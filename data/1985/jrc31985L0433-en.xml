      <p n="2">*****</p>
      <p n="3">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE</p>
      <p n="4">of 16 September 1985</p>
      <p n="5">concerning the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in pharmacy, including measures to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment relating to certain activities in the field of pharmacy</p>
      <p n="6">(85/433/EEC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN</p>
      <p n="8">COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 49 and 57 thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="11">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="12">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, pursuant to the Treaty, all discriminatory treatment based on nationality with regard to establishment and provision of services is prohibited as from the end of the transitional period; whereas the principle of such treatment based on nationality applies, in particular, to the grant of any authorization required for the practice of certain activities, and also to registration with or membership of professional organizations or bodies;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas it nevertheless seems desirable that certain provisions be introduced to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas, pursuant to Article 54 (3) (h) of the Treaty, the Member States are required not to grant any form of aid likely to distort the conditions of establishment;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas Article 57 (1) of the Treaty provides that Directives be adopted for mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas, in view of the present disparities in training in pharmacy given in the Member States, it is necessary to lay down certain coordinating provisions to enable the Member States to introduce mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications; whereas such coordination has been established by Council Directive 85/432/EEC of 16 September 1985, concerning the coordination of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of certain activities in the field of pharmacy (4);</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas in certain Member States access to certain activities in the field of pharmacy is, apart from the award of the relevant diploma, certificate or other formal qualification, subject to the requirement of additional professional experience; whereas, since there is as yet no convergence of views among the Member States on this point, it is advisable, in order to obviate any difficulties, to recognize as a sufficient condition appropriate practical experience of equal duration acquired in another Member State;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas, under their national policies in the sphere of public health, which seek inter alia to ensure the satisfactory dispensing of medicinal products over their entire territories, certain Member States restrict the number of new pharmacies that may be established, while others have adopted no such provisions; whereas in these circumstances it is premature to provide that the effects of the recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in pharmacy must also extend to the pursuit of the activities of pharmacist as the controller of a pharmacy open to the public for less than three years; whereas this problem must be re-examined by the Commission and the Council within a certain period;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas, with regard to the possession of a formal certificate of training, since a Directive on the mutual recognition of diplomas does not necessarily imply equivalence in the training covered by such diplomas, the use of such qualifications should be authorized only in the language of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas, to facilitate the application of this Directive by the national authorities, Member States may prescribe that, in addition to formal certificates of training, the person who satisfies the conditions of training required by this Directive must provide a certificate from the competent authorities of his country of origin or of the country from which he comes stating that these certificates of training are those covered by the Directive;</p>
      <p n="22">Whereas this Directive does not affect the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in the Member States which prohibit companies from practising certain activities or impose on them certain conditions for such practice;</p>
      <p n="23">Whereas it is difficult to assess the extent to which rules aimed at facilitating freedom of pharmacists to provide services could at present be appropriate; whereas, in these circumstances, it is not advisable to adopt such rules for the time being;</p>
      <p n="24">Whereas, with regard to good character and good repute, a distinction should be drawn between the requirements to be satisfied on first taking up the profession and those to be satisfied in order to practise it;</p>
      <p n="25">Whereas, as far as the activities of employed persons are concerned, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (1) lays down no specific provisions relating to good character or good repute, professional discipline or use of title for the professions covered; whereas, depending on the individual Member State, such rules are or may be applicable both to employed and self-employed persons; whereas the activities subject in the Member States to possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification in pharmacy are pursued by both employed and self-employed persons, or by the same persons in both capacities in the course of their professional career; whereas, in order to encourage as far as possible the free movement of those professional persons within the Community, it therefore appears necessary to extend the application of this Directive to employed persons.</p>
      <p n="26">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="27">CHAPTER I</p>
      <p n="28">Scope</p>
      <p n="29">Article 1</p>
      <p n="30">This Directive applies to activities, the access to and pursuit of which is subject to conditions of professional qualification in one or more Member States, and which are open to holders of one of the diplomas, certificates or other formal qualifications in pharmacy referred to in Article 4.</p>

      <p n="33">Article 2</p>
      <p n="34">1.

      <p n="35">2. However, Member States need not give effect to the diplomas, certificates and other formal certificates referred to in paragraph 1 with respect to the establishment of new pharmacies open to the public. For the purposes of applying this Directive, pharmacies which have been in operation for less than three years shall also be regarded as new.</p>
      <p n="36">Five years after the date stipulated in Article 19 (1), the Commission shall submit a report to the Council on the way in which Member States have implemented the preceding subparagraph and on the possibility of extending the effects of mutual recognition of the diplomas, certificates and other formal certificates referred to in paragraph 1.

      <p n="39">As long as the Hellenic Republic makes use of this derogation and without prejudice to Article 45 of the 1979 Act of Accession, the other Member States shall not be required to give effect as provided for in Article 2 to the certificates referred to in Article 4 (d) except in the case of the pursuit as an employed person in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the activities referred to in Article 1.</p>
      <p n="40">2. Ten years after the date stipulated in Article 19, the Commission shall submit to the Council appropriate proposals in order to extend the effects of mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other formal qualifications with a view to facilitating the effective exercise of the right of establishment between the Hellenic Republic and the other Member States. The Council shall act on these proposals in accordance with the procedure laid down in the EEC Treaty.</p>
