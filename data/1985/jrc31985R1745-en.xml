      <p n="3">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1745/85</p>
      <p n="4">of 26 June 1985</p>
      <p n="5">amending Regulation (EEC) No 2290/83 laying down provisions for the implementation of Articles 50 to 59 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 setting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN</p>
      <p n="7">COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council regard (EEC) No 918/83 of 28 March 1983 setting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty (1), and in particular Article 143 thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Article 2 (1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2290/83 (2) inter alia obliges the establishment or organization to which the goods are consigned to use the imported goods exclusively for non-commercial purposes within the meaning of the second indent of Article 54 of the basic Regulation; whereas this requirement does not emerge from the provisions of the basic Regulation as regards goods imported under Article 51 of the said basic Regulation; whereas the wording of Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2290/83 must be amended accordingly;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the experience gained since the entry into force of Regulation (EEC) No 2290/83 has shown that the phrase to be entered on Control Copy T No 5 does not correctly inform the customs authorities of the Member State of destination of their obligation to ensure that the organization receiving the instrument or apparatus will use it in accordance with the conditions laid down for the continued grant of relief of customs duty; whereas that phrase ought therefore to be amended;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas Article 16 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2290/83 provides that each Member State shall send the Commission a list of the instruments, apparatus, spare parts, components, accessories and tools of which the price or the value for customs purposes exceeds 3 000 ECU and for which it has authorized admission free of import duties under Article 7 (1) or 14 (1); whereas this threshold was set in 1980, because Regulation (EEC) No 2290/83 reproduced, unchanged, the threshold set in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 (3) which was formerly applicable; whereas this threshold has not been amended since;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it would seem appropriate to raise this threshold to 5 000 ECU;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Duty-Free Arrangements,</p>
