      <p n="9">Whereas experience gained since the adoption of Directive 76/768/EEC has shown that the provisions on labelling should be improved and that the period laid down in Article 12 (2) is inadequate,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1 Directive 76/768/EEC is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="12">1. In Article 1, paragraph 3 is replaced by:</p>
      <p n="13">´3. Cosmetic products containing one of the substances listed in Annex V shall be excluded from the scope of this Directive. Member States may take such measures as they deem necessary with regard to those products.'</p>

      <p n="21">(c) the preservatives listed in Annex VI, Part 2, within the limits and under the condition laid down, until the dates given in column (f) of that Annex. However, some of these substances may be used in other concentrations for specific purposes apparent from the presentation of the product;</p>

      <p n="29">1. Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that cosmetic products may be marketed only if the container and packaging bear the following informarion in indelible, easily legible and visible lettering:</p>
      <p n="30">(a) the name or style and the address or registered office of the manufacturer or the person responsible for marketing the cosmetic product who is established within the Community. Such information may be abbreviated in so far as the abbreviation makes it generally possible to identify the undertaking. Member States may require that the country of origin be specified for goods manufactured outside the Community;</p>
      <p n="31">b) the nominal content at the time of packaging, given by weight or by volume, except in the case of packaging containing less than five grams or five millilitres, free samples and single-application packs; for pre-packages normally sold as a number of items, for which details of weight or volume are not significant, the content need not be given provided the number of items appears on the packaging. This information need not be given if the number of items is easy to see from the outside or if the product is normally only sold individually;</p>
      <p n="32">c) the date of minimum durability. The date of minimum durability of a cosmetic product shall be the date until which this product, stored under appropriate conditions, continues to fulfil its initial function and, in particular, remains in conformity with Article 2.</p>

      <p n="34">- the date itself, or</p>
      <p n="35">- details of where the date appears on the packaging.</p>

      <p n="39">(e) the batch number of manufacture or the reference for identifying the goods. Where this is impossible for practical reasons because the cosmetic products are too small, such information need appear only on the packaging.</p>
      <p n="40">2. For cosmetic products that are not pre-packaged, are packaged at the point of sale at the purchaser's request, or are pre-packaged for immediate sale, Member States shall adopt detailed rules for indication of the particulars referred to in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p n="41">3.
