      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3994/88 of 21 December 1988 amending Regulation (EEC) No 890/78 laying down detailed rules for the certification of hops</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971 on the common organization of the market in hops (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3998/87 (2), and in particular Article 2 (5) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 890/78 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3589/85 (4), stipulates that only hops complying with the definition in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 and the minimum marketing requirements laid down in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 890/78 may obtain the certificate referred to in Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1784/77 of 19 July 1977 concerning the certification of hops (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2039/85 (6);</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas experience has shown that it is impossible to exclude the presence of particles of other varieties of hops in samples; whereas that fact does not impair the characteristics of the product to be certified; whereas very small quantities of such particles should therefore be allowed; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 890/78 should be amended accordingly;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Hops,</p>
      <p n="9">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="10">Article 1 In line (c) in the column headed ´Description' of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 890/78, ´which generally do not come from the cone' is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="11">´which generally do not come from the cone; the maximum contents indicated may include particles of varieties of hops other than those to be certified, amounting to up to 2 % of the weight'.</p>
      <p n="12">Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="13">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="14">Done at Brussels, 21 December 1988.</p>
