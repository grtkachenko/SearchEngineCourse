      <p n="11">Whereas the length and the technical complexity of Commission Directive 87/94/EEC (3) - the various methods of analysis and test are taken from different technological disciplines - and the number of languagues to be made to correspond reveal, after adoption of the Directive by the Commission, that a linguistic revision and some technical corrections are necessary (4);</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas this linguistic revision and the technical corrections necessitate an extension of the time limit for complying with this Directive in the Member States, and a postponement of the date appears essential;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the amendments provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives for the removal of technical barriers to trade in fertilizers,</p>
