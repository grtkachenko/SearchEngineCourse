      <p n="3">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1315/88</p>
      <p n="4">of 3 May 1988</p>
      <p n="5">amending Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff and Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 setting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas Section II C of the preliminary provisions of the combined nomenclature annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (4), provides for customs duty to be charged at the flat rate of 10 % ad valorem on goods sent in small consignments to private individuals or contained in travellers' personal luggage, provided that such importations are not of a commercial nature and that the total value of such goods does not exceed 115 ECU per consignment or per traveller;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, in accordance with Section II C (3) of the said preliminary provisions, the flat rate 10 % customs duty is charged in respect of goods contained in travellers' personal luggage only on the fraction of the value exceeding the amounts admitted free of import duties pursuant to Article 45 to 49 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 (5), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3822/85 (6); whereas, however, as a result of the third indent of Article 29 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83, the flat of 10 % is charged on all goods in small consignments sent to private individuals where the total value of the said consignments exceeds the amount laid down for their duty-free admission, i.e. 45 ECU;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the disadvantage of these rules is that they preclude any relief for the consignees of small consignments whose total value exceeds, even by a small margin, the amount of 45 ECU; whereas examination of the situation has revealed that the introduction in this particular context of provisions similar to those applicable to goods contained in travellers' personal luggage should not cause serious administrative difficulties; whereas it is accordingly appropriate to amend both Section II C of the preliminary provisions of the combined nomenclature and Title VII of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 to permit relief on the import of small consignments sent to private individuals up to a value of 45 ECU and to charge the flat rate 10 % customs duty only on the fraction of the value exceeding that amount;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas at this juncture the value beyond which the flat rate of 10 % customs duty may be charged on consignments sent to private individuals should be raised from 115 ECU to 200 ECU, as the Commission proposed on 16 November 1984 (7); whereas for reasons of legal clarity, all these amendments should be made by means of a complete redrafting of Section II C of the preliminary provisions of the combined nomenclature and Title VII of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 provides that the island of Heligoland is to be considered a third country; whereas as a result of the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2151/84 of 23 July 1984 on the customs territory of the Community (8), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, that all territories excluded from the customs territory of the Community are in the same legal position as Heligoland; whereas it is therefore necessary to amend the said Article 1 (3);</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas Articles 137 and 138 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 lay down the conditions on which, until the establishment of Community provisions in the field in question, Member States may apply special relief granted on imports of instruments and apparatus used in medical research, establishing medical diagnoses or carrying out medical treatment;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas the experience acquired from application of these provisions by one Member State has shown that the duty-free admission of the instruments and apparatus in question, provided that equivalent instruments and apparatus are not being manufactured in the Community cannot have untoward effects on the Community economy; whereas it would, however, make an effective contribution to the detection and treatment of serious diseases which may affect persons residing in the Community; whereas it is advisable to encourage any donations of such instruments or apparatus to medical institutions approved for these purposes by the competent authorities; whereas the optional and temporary provisions laid down by Articles 137 and 138 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 in respect of instruments and apparatus used in medical research, establishing medical diagnoses or carrying out medical treatment</p>
      <p n="18">should be converted into definitive provisions applicable throughout the Community and, to this end, the said Articles should be replaced by a Title XIVa dealing with this particular case of relief;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 should also be supplemented to take account of the work carried out by the World Health Organization by introduction of relief from import duties in respect of the reference substances required for the quality control of medicinal products;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas, on the basis of work carried out within the Committee on Duty Free Arrangements since the entry into force of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83, it has been established that a certain number of temporary provisions foreseen in Article 136 could, under certain conditions, be transformed into definite provisions or limited in time, or be deleted; whereas Articles 133 to 136 should accordingly be amended in order to remove as far as possible any uncertainty as regards their scope and any disparity in application of the Community system of reliefs from customs duty set up by Regulation (EEC) No 918/83;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas it is advisable to take the opportunity arising from these various amendments to Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 to amend certain other provisions so that their application is more consistent with the objectives pursued, or to ensure compliance with provisions adopted within the framework of certain international organizations, notably the Council Decision-Recommendation of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) adopted on 27 November 1985 concerning policy in the field of international tourism,</p>
      <p n="22">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="23">Article 1</p>
      <p n="24">Section II C of the preliminary provisions of the combined nomenclature annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="25">'C. Standard rate of duty</p>
      <p n="26">1. Customs duty shall be charged at the flat rate of 10 % ad valorem on goods:</p>
      <p n="27">- contained in consignments sent by one private individual to another,</p>
      <p n="28">- contained in travellers' personal luggage,</p>
      <p n="29">provided that such importations are not of a commercial nature.</p>
      <p n="30">This flat rate 10 % customs duty shall apply provided that the value of the goods subject to import duty does not exceed 200 ECU per consignment or per traveller.</p>
      <p n="31">Such flat-rate assessment shall not apply to goods falling within Chapter 24 which are contained in a consignment or in travellers' personal luggage in amounts exceeding those laid down in Article 31 or in Article 46 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 (1).</p>
      <p n="32">2. Importations shall be treated as not being of a commercial nature if:</p>
      <p n="33">(a) in the case of goods contained in consignments sent by one private individual to another, such consignments:</p>
      <p n="34">- are of an occasional nature,</p>
      <p n="35">- contain goods exclusively for the personal use of the consignee or his family; which do not by their nature or quantity reflect any commercial interest,</p>
      <p n="36">- are sent to the consignee by the consignor free of payment of any kind;</p>
      <p n="37">(b) in the case of goods contained in travellers' personal luggage, they:</p>
      <p n="38">- are of an occasional nature, and</p>
      <p n="39">- consist exclusively of goods for the personal use of the travellers or their families, or of goods intended as presents; the nature and quantity of such goods must not be such as might indicate that they are being imported for commercial reasons.</p>
      <p n="40">3. The flat rate of customs duty shall not apply to goods imported under the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 if the person entitled has, before the said flat rate is applied to them, requested that they be subject to the customs duties appropriate to them. All the goods making up the consignment shall then be subject to the import duties which are appropriate to them, without prejudice to the duty-free admission provided for pursuant to Articles 29 to 31 and 45 to 49 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83.</p>
      <p n="41">For the purposes of the first subparagraph, import duties shall mean both customs duties and charges having equivalent effect and agricultural levies and other import charges provided for under the common agricultural policy or under specific arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products.</p>
      <p n="42">4. Member States may round off the amount in national currencies resulting from the conversion of the sum of 200 ECU.</p>
      <p n="43">5. Member States may maintain unchanged the equivalent in national currency of the sum of 200 ECU if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in the first paragraph of Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2779/78, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 289/84 (2), the conversion of this amount, before the rounding off provided for in paragraph 4, results in a change of less than 5 % in the equivalent in national currency, or in a reduction thereof.</p>

Subject to the same conditions, presents customarily given on the occasion of a marriage, which are received by a person fulfilling the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 from persons having their normal place of residence in a third country shall also be admitted free of import duties. The value of each present admitted duty-free may not, however, exceed 1 000 ECU.'</p>
