      <p n="10">ACKNOWLEDGING that special provision is required to meet the needs of developing countries for these substances,</p>
      <p n="11">NOTING the precautionary measures for controlling emissions of certain chlorofluorocarbons that have already been taken at national and regional levels,</p>
      <p n="12">CONSIDERING the importance of promoting international cooperation in the research and development of science and technology relating to the control and reduction of emissions of substances that deplete the ozone layer, bearing in mind in particular the needs of developing countries,</p>
      <p n="13">HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">Definitions</p>
      <p n="16">For the purposes of this Protocol:</p>
      <p n="17">1. 'Convention' means the Vienna Convention for the protection of the ozone layer, adopted on 22 March 1985.</p>
      <p n="18">2. 'Parties' means, unless the text indicates, Parties to this Protocol.</p>
      <p n="19">3. 'Secretariat' means the secretariat of the Convention.</p>
      <p n="20">4. 'Controlled substance' means a substance listed in Annex A to this Protocol, whether existing alone or in a mixture. It excludes, however, any such substance or mixture which is in a manufactured product other than a container used for the transportation or storage of the substance listed.</p>
      <p n="21">5. 'Production' means the amount of controlled substances produced minus the amount destroyed by technologies to be approved by the Parties.</p>
      <p n="22">6. 'Consumption' means production plus imports minus exports of controlled substances.</p>
      <p n="23">7. 'Calculated levels' of production, imports, exports and consumption means levels determined in accordance with Article 3.</p>
      <p n="24">8. 'Industrial rationalization' means the transfer of all or a portion of the calculated level of production of one Party to another, for the purpose of achieving economic efficiencies or responding to anticipated shortfalls in supply as a result of plant closures.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 2</p>
      <p n="26">Control measures</p>
      <p n="27">1. Each Party shall ensure that for the 12-month period commencing on the first day of the seventh month following</p>
      <p n="28">the date of the entry into force of this Protocol, and in each 12-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A does not exceed its calculated level of consumption in 1986. By the end of the same period, each Party producing one or more of these substances shall ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed its calculated level of production in 1986, except that such level may have increased by no more than 10 % based on the 1986 level. Such increase shall be permitted only so as to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Parties operating under Article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between Parties.</p>
      <p n="29">2. Each Party shall ensure that for the 12-month period commencing on the first day of the 37th month following the date of the entry into force of this Protocol, and in each 12-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances listed in Group II of Annex A does not exceed its calculated level of consumption in 1986. Each Party producing one or more of these substances shall ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed its calculated level of production in 1986, except that such level may have increased by no more than 10 % based on the 1986 level. Such increase shall be permitted only so as to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Parties operating under Article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between Parties. The mechanisms for implementing these measures shall be decided by the Parties at their first meeting following the first scientific review.</p>
      <p n="30">3. Each Party shall ensure that for the period 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994 and in each 12-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A does not exceed, annually, 80 % of its calculated level of consumption in 1986. Each Party producing one or more of these substances shall, for the same periods, ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed, annually, 80 % of its calculated level of production in 1986. However, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Parties operating under Article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between Parties, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by up to 10 % of its calculated level of production in 1986.</p>
      <p n="31">4. Each Party shall ensure that for the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, and in each 12-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A does not exceed, annually, 50 % of its calculated level of consumption in 1986. Each Party producing one or more of these substances shall, for the same periods, ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed, annually, 50 % of its calculated level of production in 1986. However, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Parties operating under Article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between Parties, its calculated level of production may exceed that</p>
      <p n="32">limit by up to 15 % of its calculated level of production in</p>
      <p n="33">1986. This paragraph will apply unless the Parties decide otherwise at a meeting by a two-thirds majority of Parties present and voting, representing at least two-thirds of the total calculated level of consumption of these substances of the Parties. This decision shall be considered and made in the light of the assessments referred to in Article 6.</p>
      <p n="34">5. Any Party whose calculated level of production in 1986 of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A was less than 25 kilotonnes may, for the purposes of industrial rationalization, transfer to or receive from any other Party, production in excess of the limits set out in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 provided that the total combined calculated levels of production of the Parties concerned does not exceed the production limits set out in this Article. Any transfer of such production shall be notified to the secretariat, no later than the time of the transfer.</p>
      <p n="35">6. Any Party not operating under Article 5, that has facilities for the production of controlled substances under construction, or contracted for, prior to 16 September 1987, and provided for in national legislation prior to 1 January 1987, may add the production from such facilities to its 1986 production of such substances for the purposes of determining its calculated level of production for 1986, provided that such facilities are completed by 31 December 1990 and that such production does not raise that Party's annual calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances above 0,5 kilograms per capita.</p>
      <p n="36">7. Any transfer of production pursuant to paragraph 5 or any addition of production pursuant to paragraph 6 shall be notified to the secretariat, no later than the time of the transfer or addition.</p>
      <p n="37">8.</p>
      <p n="38">(a) Any Parties which are Member States of a regional economic integration organization as defined in Article 1 (6) of the Convention may agree that they shall jointly fulfil their obligations respecting consumption under this Article provided that their total combined calculated level of consumption does not exceed the levels required by this Article.</p>
      <p n="39">(b) The Parties to any such agreement shall inform the secretariat of the terms of the agreement before the date of the reduction in consumption with which the agreement is concerned.</p>
      <p n="40">(c) Such agreement will become operative only if all Member States of the regional economic integration organization and the organization concerned are Parties to the Protocol and have notified the secretariat of their manner of implementation.</p>
      <p n="41">9.</p>
      <p n="42">(a) Based on the assessment made pursuant to Article 6, the Parties may decide whether:</p>
      <p n="43">i(i) adjustments to the ozone-depleting potentials specified in Annex A should be made and, if so, what the adjustments should be; and</p>
      <p n="44">(ii) further adjustments and reductions of production or consumption of the controlled substances from 1986 levels should be undertaken and, if so, what the scope, amount and timing of any such adjustment and reductions should be.</p>
      <p n="45">(b) Proposals for such adjustments shall be communicated to the Parties by the secretariat at least six month before the meeting of the Parties at which they are proposed for adoption.</p>
      <p n="46">(c) In taking such decisions, the Parties shall make every effort to reach agreement by consensus. If all efforts at consensus have been exhausted, and no agreement reached, such decisions shall, as a last resort, be adopted by a two-thirds majority vote of the Parties present and voting representing at least 50 % of the total consumption of the controlled substances of the Parties.</p>
      <p n="47">(d) The decisions, which shall be binding on all Parties, shall forthwith be communicated to the Parties by the Depositary. Unless otherwise provided in the decisions, they shall enter into force on the expiry of six months from the date of the circulation of the communication by the Depositary.</p>
      <p n="48">10.</p>
      <p n="49">(a) Based on the assessment made pursuant to Article 6 of this Protocol and in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 9 of the Convention, the Parties may decide:</p>
      <p n="50">i(i) whether any substances, and if so which, should be added to or removed from any annex to this Protocol; and</p>
      <p n="51">(ii) the mechanism, scope and timing of the control measures that should apply to those substances.</p>
      <p n="52">(b) Any such decision shall become effective, provided that it has been accepted by a two-thirds majority vote of the Parties present and voting.</p>
      <p n="53">11. Notwithstanding the provisions contained in this Article, Parties may take more stringent measures than those required by this Article.</p>

      <p n="55">Calculation of control levels</p>
      <p n="56">For the purposes of Articles 2 and 5, each Party shall, for each group of substances in Annex A, determine its calculated levels of:</p>
      <p n="57">(a) production by:</p>
      <p n="58">i(i) multiplying its annual production of each controlled substance by the ozone-depleting potential specified in respect of it in Annex A; and</p>
      <p n="59">(ii) adding together, for each such group, the resulting figures;</p>
      <p n="60">(b) imports and exports, respectively, by following, mutatis mutandis, the procedure set out in subparagraph (a); and</p>
      <p n="61">(c) consumption by adding together its calculated levels of production and imports and subtracting its calculated level of exports as determined in accordance with subparagraphs (a) and (b). However, beginning on 1 January 1993, any export of controlled substances to non-parties shall not be subtracted in calculating the consumption level of the exporting Party.</p>
      <p n="62">Article 4</p>
      <p n="63">Control of trade with non-parties</p>
      <p n="64">1. Within one year of the entry into force of this Protocol, each Party shall ban the import of controlled substances from any State not party to this Protocol.</p>
      <p n="65">2. Beginning on 1 January 1993, no Party operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 may export any controlled substance to any State not party to this Protocol.</p>
      <p n="66">3. Within three years of the date of the entry into force of this Protocol, the Parties shall, following the procedures in Article 10 of the Convention, elaborate in an annex a list of products containing controlled substances. Parties that have not objected to the annex in accordance with those procedures shall ban, within one year of the annex having become effective, the import of those products from any State not party to this Protocol.</p>
      <p n="67">4. Within five years of the entry into force of this Protocol, the Parties shall determine the feasibility of banning or restricting, from States not party to this Protocol, the import of products produced with, but not containing, controlled substances. If determined feasible, the Parties shall, following the procedures in Article 10 of the Convention, elaborate in an annex a list of such products. Parties that have not objected to it in accordance with those procedures shall ban or restrict, within one year of the annex having become effective the import of those products from any State not party to this Protocol.</p>
      <p n="68">5. Each Party shall discourage the export, to any State not party to this Protocol, of technology for producing and for utilizing controlled substances.</p>
      <p n="69">6. Each Party shall refrain from providing new subsidies, aid, credits, guarantees or insurance programmes for the export to States not party to this Protocol of products, equipment, plants or technology that would facilitate the production of controlled substances.</p>
      <p n="70">7. Paragraphs 5 and 6 shall not apply to products, equipment, plants or technology that improve the containment, recovery, recycling or destruction of controlled substances, promote the development of alternative substances, or otherwise contribute to the reduction of emissions of controlled substances.</p>
      <p n="71">8. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, imports referred to in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 may be permitted from any State not party to this Protocol if that State is determined, by a meeting of the Parties, to be in full compliance with Article 2 and this Article, and has submitted data to that effect as specified in Article 7.</p>
      <p n="72">Article 5</p>
      <p n="73">Special situation of developing countries</p>
      <p n="74">1. Any Party that is a developing country and whose annual calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances is less than 0,3 kilograms per capita on the date of the entry into force of the Protocol for it, or any time thereafter within 10 years of the date of entry into force of the Protocol shall, in order to meet its basic domestic needs, be entitled to delay its compliance with the control measures set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 of Article 2 by 10 years after that specified in those paragraphs. However, such Party shall not exceed an annual calculated level of consumption of 0,3 kilograms per capita. Any such Party shall be entitled to use either the average of its annual calculated level of consumption for the period 1995 to 1997 inclusive or a calculated level of consumption of 0,3 kilograms per capita, whichever is the lower, as the basis for its compliance with the control measures.</p>
      <p n="75">2. The Parties undertake to facilitate access to environmentally safe alternative substances and technology for Parties that are developing countries and assist them to make expeditious use of such alternatives.</p>
