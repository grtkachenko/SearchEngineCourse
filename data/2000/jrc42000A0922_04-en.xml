      <p n="61">(c) Moroccan nationals who are not resident in the provinces of Tetuan or Nador and who wish to enter the territory of the towns of Ceuta and Melilla exclusively shall remain subject to the visa requirement. The validity of these visas shall be limited to these two towns and may permit multiple entries and exits ("visado limitado múltiple") in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(3) and Article 11(1)(a) of the 1990 Convention.</p>
      <p n="62">(d) The interests of the other Contracting Parties shall be taken into account when applying these arrangements.</p>
      <p n="63">(e) Pursuant to its national law and in order to verify whether passengers still satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 5 of the 1990 Convention on the basis which they were authorised to enter national territory upon passport control at the external border, Spain shall maintain checks (on identity and documents) on sea and air connections departing from Ceuta and Melilla and having as their sole destination any other place on Spanish territory.</p>
      <p n="64">To the same end, Spain shall maintain checks on internal flights and on regular ferry connections departing from the towns of Ceuta and Melilla to a destination in another State party to the Convention.</p>
