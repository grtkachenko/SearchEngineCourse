      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>

      <p n="17">The suspension shall apply from the date of application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2563/2000 amending Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000.</p>
      <p n="18">The text of the Exchange of Letters is attached hereto.</p>
