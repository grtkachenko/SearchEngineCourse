      <p n="2">Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000</p>
      <p n="3">of 5 December 2000</p>
      <p n="4">on the European Agency for Reconstruction</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament(1),</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Assistance for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been implemented essentially under Regulation (EC) No 1628/96(2) and under Council Regulation (EC) No 3906/89 of 18 December 1989 on economic aid to certain countries of Central and Eastern Europe(3).</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Regulation (EC) No 1628/96, established the European Agency for Reconstruction.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) The Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000(4), which lays down a single legal framework for Community assistance to those countries and repeals Regulation (EC) No 1628/96.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) The provisions governing the establishment and operation of the European Agency for Reconstruction should therefore be adapted to Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000 and incorporated in a new Regulation, and the appropriate changes made at the same time.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) The Feira European Council of 19 and 20 June 2000 emphasised that the European Agency for Reconstruction, as an authority implementing the future CARDS programme, should be allowed to use its full potential in order to achieve the goals set by the Cologne European Council of 3 and 4 June 1999.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) The Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Regulation, powers other than those under Article 308,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">The Commission may delegate to an Agency implementation of the Community assistance provided for in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000 to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>

      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">1. To achieve the objective laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 1, the Agency shall carry out the following tasks, within the limits of its powers and in accordance with the decisions taken by the Commission:</p>

      <p n="24">(ii) the urgent requirements of the communities concerned, taking account of the various population displacements and the possibilities for the return of those displaced;</p>
      <p n="25">(iii) the priority sectors and geographical areas requiring urgent assistance from the international community;</p>
      <p n="26">(b) preparing draft programmes for the reconstruction of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the return of refugees and displaced persons in accordance with guidelines provided by the Commission;</p>
      <p n="27">(c) implementing the Community assistance referred to in Article 1, wherever possible in cooperation with the local population and where necessary by drawing on the services of operators selected by tender.
