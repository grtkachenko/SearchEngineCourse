      <p n="2">Council Regulation (EC) No 2563/2000</p>
      <p n="3">of 20 November 2000</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 by extending to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia the exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's stabilisation and association process and amending Regulation (EC) No 2820/98</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's stabilisation and association process, amending Regulation (EC) No 2820/98, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 6/2000(1), does not apply to imports into the Community of products originating in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the exception of wine imports and does not apply to all imports from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The suspension, by means of an Exchange of Letters, of the trade and trade-related provisions of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia(2) signed on 29 April 1997 allows for autonomous trade preferences to be granted to that country.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), in the light of recent developments in the country, complies with the basic conditions for the granting of autonomous trade preferences as set out in the Council conclusions of 29 April 1997. The General Affairs Council of 9 October 2000 invited the Commission to submit proposals on extending to the FRY the benefit of the exceptional trade measures as provided by Regulation (EC) 2007/2000.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Kosovo, as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999 is subject to international civil administration by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) which has established a separate customs administration.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) It is, therefore, appropriate to extend fully the arrangements provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo as defined by UNSC Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999,</p>
