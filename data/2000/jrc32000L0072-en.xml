      <p n="2">Commission Directive 2000/72/EC</p>
      <p n="3">of 22 November 2000</p>
      <p n="4">adapting to technical progress Council Directive 93/31/EEC on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles(1), as amended by Directive 2000/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 16 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 93/31/EEC of 14 June 1993 on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles(3), and in particular Article 3 thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Directive 93/31/EEC is one of the separate directives under the Community type-approval procedure introduced by Directive 92/61/EEC. The provisions of Directive 92/61/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to that Directive.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) Developments in technology now enable Directive 93/31/EEC to be adapted to technical progress. In order to enable the full type-approval system to function properly, it is therefore necessary to clarify or supplement certain requirements of the Directive concerned.</p>
      <p n="13">(3) To this end, it should be specified that when conducting stability tests on an inclined surface, the transverse and longitudinal tilt tests should be carried out separately.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress set up under Article 13 of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(4), as last amended by European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/40/EC(5),</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">The Annex to Directive 93/31/EEC is hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">1. With effect from 1 January 2002, Member States may not, on grounds relating to stands:</p>
      <p n="20">- refuse to grant EC type-approval for a type of two-wheel motor vehicle, or</p>
      <p n="21">- prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of two-wheel motor vehicles;</p>
      <p n="22">if the stands of those vehicles comply with the requirements of Directive 93/31/EEC, as amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="23">2. With effect from 1 July 2002, Member States shall refuse to grant EC type-approval for any new type of two-wheel motor vehicle on grounds relating to stands if the requirements of Directive 93/31/EEC, as amended by this Directive, are not fulfilled.</p>
      <p n="24">Article 3</p>
      <p n="25">1. Member States shall adopt and publish, no later than 31 December 2001, the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="26">They shall apply those provisions from 1 January 2002.</p>
      <p n="27">When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.</p>
      <p n="28">2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law that they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="29">Article 4</p>
      <p n="30">This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="31">Article 5</p>
      <p n="32">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="33">Done at Brussels, 22 November 2000.</p>
      <p n="34">For the Commission</p>
