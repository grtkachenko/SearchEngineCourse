      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 of 26 October 1971 on the common organisation of the market in seeds(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1405/1999(2), and in particular Article 3(6) thereof,</p>

      <p n="12">(4) In order to ensure uniform application throughout the Community of the rules for granting the aid, a list should be established of the different varieties of Cannabis sativa L. eligible for aid under Article 3(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 and the list laid down in Annex B to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1164/89 of 28 April 1989 laying down detailed rules concerning the aid for fibre flax and hemp(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1313/2000(8) should be used for that purpose.</p>

      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
