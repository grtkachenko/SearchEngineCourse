      <p n="2">Council Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 29 June 2000</p>
      <p n="4">on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy</p>
      <p n="5">(2000/439/EC)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Article 16 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 of 20 December 1992 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture(3), provides that the situation as regards fishery resources, and its economic implications, needs to be assessed regularly.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) Regulation (EC) No 1543/2000(4) establishes a Community framework for the collection and management of the fisheries data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy (CFP).</p>
      <p n="13">(3) By collecting these data, Member States are carrying out a task which is beneficial to the Community in that it contributes to the more efficient management of the common resources. While implementation of the programmes is the responsibility of the Member States, they should therefore qualify for a contribution from the Community towards certain costs incurred in collecting and managing the said data.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) The action taken by the Commission to assist the collection of these data through annual calls for proposals financed as FIFG innovative measures has reached a level of stability. This action should be consolidated, therefore, on a multiannual basis.</p>
      <p n="15">(5) A financial reference, within the meaning of point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 May 1999, is included in this Decision for the entire duration of the period for which financial assistance is to be provided, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as defined by the Treaty.</p>
      <p n="16">(6) In order to guarantee the necessary financial resources, the preparation of the national programmes and the corresponding Commission decision to co-finance them should take place the year before their execution.</p>
      <p n="17">(7) Provision should be made to ensure, in 2001, the collection of basic data needed to conduct the CFP.</p>
      <p n="18">(8) The methods used to collect and process the basic data on fisheries should be compared, and ways should be sought of improving them. The quality of the results obtained should be examined and assessed regularly.</p>
      <p n="19">(9) Financial assistance should therefore be granted to explore the possibilities and usefulness of extending the scope of the Community framework for the collection and management of basic data.</p>
      <p n="20">(10) The pilot projects and studies needed to carry out the CFP should be eligible for support, in particular for economic and bio-economic analyses, work on eliminating and preventing overcapacity, and the relations between fisheries, aquaculture and the development of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
      <p n="21">(11) Steps should be taken to ensure the satisfactory outcome of the measures financed under this Decision.</p>
      <p n="22">(12) In order to facilitate implementation of these provisions, there should be a procedure for close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within a management committee.</p>
      <p n="23">(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).</p>
      <p n="24">(14) Rules should be laid down governing the eligibility of the expenditure, the level of the Community contribution and the terms on which it will be made available,</p>
      <p n="25">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="26">Article 1</p>
      <p n="27">1. The Community may provide financial assistance for the measures referred to in this Decision under the terms and conditions laid down herein.</p>

      <p n="51">1. The assistance granted to a Member State in respect of each year of application of the programme shall be paid in two instalments as follows:</p>

      <p n="114">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="115">Expenditure eligible under Community programmes</p>
      <p n="116">Without prejudice to paragraph 4, eligible expenditure shall consist only of expenditure actually borne by the beneficiary and the participants between the date of commencement of the project and its date of completion, and required for carrying out the work. Eligible expenditure may include all or some of the following:</p>
      <p n="117">- staff costs</p>
      <p n="118">- travelling expenses</p>
      <p n="119">- durable goods</p>
      <p n="120">- consumable materials and supplies</p>
      <p n="121">- vessels</p>

      <p n="127">- actual labour costs (wages, social costs, social security and pension contributions), or</p>
      <p n="128">- average labour costs, in line with the practice of the beneficiary or the participant concerned, if this average does not diverge significantly from actual labour costs.</p>
      <p n="129">1.3. Time devoted by staff to the programme and apportioned must appear in full in the records (time sheets) and be certified at least once each month by the person responsible for the programme or any other competent member of the managerial staff working on the programme.</p>
      <p n="130">2. Travelling expenses</p>
      <p n="131">2.1. Travelling expenses shall be apportioned in accordance with the internal rules of the beneficiaries or participants; however, for journeys outside the Community, prior agreement of the Commission shall be required.</p>

For the purpose of calculating the eligible expenditure, durable goods will be considered to have a probable life of 36 months in the case of computer equipment of a value not exceeding EUR 10000, and 60 months in the case of other goods. The eligible amount will depend on the expected life of the goods in relation to the duration of the programme, on condition that the period used to calculate this amount starts on the actual date of commencement of the programme, or the date of purchase of the goods where this occurs after the date of commencement, and ends on the date of completion of the programme. Account should be taken also of the use made of the goods during that period.</p>
      <p n="138">3.3. For each purchase of durable goods, a certified copy of the invoice must be attached to the statement of income and expenditure, and forwarded to the Commission.</p>
      <p n="139">4. Consumable materials and supplies</p>
      <p n="140">4.1. Expenditure on consumable raw materials for the purchase, production, repair or use of any goods or equipment which:</p>
      <p n="141">- have a probable life shorter than the duration of the work under the programme, and</p>
      <p n="142">- are not included in the inventory of durable goods of the beneficiary or participant concerned, or</p>
      <p n="143">- are not regarded as assets in accordance with the accounting principles, rules and methods of the coordinator or participant concerned.</p>
      <p n="144">5. Vessels</p>
      <p n="145">For research surveys at sea, including those conducted from chartered vessels, only rental costs and other operating costs shall be eligible. A certified copy of the invoice must be attached to the statement of income and expenditure and forwarded to the Commission.</p>
      <p n="146">6. Computer costs</p>
      <p n="147">6.1. Expenditure on the establishment and supply to Member States of software for the management and interrogation of databases.</p>
      <p n="148">7. Subcontracting/outside assistance and other expenditure</p>

Subcontracting/outside assistance (standard and non-innovative services, provided for beneficiaries or partners who are unable to provide them themselves) or any other additional or unforeseen expenditure not falling within one of the above categories may be charged to the programme only with the prior agreement of the Commission.</p>
      <p n="150">7.2. Countries outside the Community may, if their contribution is necessary or desirable for carrying out Community programmes, participate as subcontractors in a national programme with the written approval of the Commission.</p>
