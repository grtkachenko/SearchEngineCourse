      <p n="2">Directive 2000/16/EC of the European Parliament and the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 10 April 2000</p>
      <p n="4">amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs and Council Directive 96/25/EC on the circulation of feed materials</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 152(4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">After consulting the Committee of the Regions,</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Council Directive 95/69/EC of 22 December 1995 laying down the conditions and arrangements for approving and registering certain establishments and intermediaries operating in the animal feed sector and amending Directives 70/524/EEC, 74/63/EEC, 79/373/EEC and 82/471/EEC(4) lays down the principle of allocating an approval number to certain establishments or intermediaries; for reasons of transparency and in order to facilitate checks, the registration number or approval number, as the case may be, should be required to be shown on the label or in the document accompanying the compound feedingstuffs.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Article 2(l) of Council Directive 79/373/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs(5) defines the minimum storage life of a compound feedingstuff as lasting until that date until which, under proper storage conditions, that feedingstuff retains its specific properties; the term "specific properties" encompasses all the properties which determine the quality of a compound feedingstuff, particularly the effectiveness of the additives it contains; this effectiveness is indicated by the expiry date of the guarantee, which has to be stated in accordance with Council Directive 70/524/EEC(6); therefore, in all cases in which the minimum storage life of an additive is the limiting factor as regards the quality of a compound feedingstuff, this date is decisive in determining the minimum storage life of the compound feedingstuff; however, the relevant provision in Article 5d(1), second subparagraph, of Directive 79/373/EEC does not provide sufficient clarity and should therefore be replaced.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The German version of Directive 79/373/EEC uses the term "circulation" (Verkehr) instead of "marketing" (Vermarktung), as in the other language versions; since there is a difference in meaning, the language versions need to be aligned; since the scope of more recent Directives on animal feed law usually extends to "putting into circulation" or "circulation", Directive 79/373/EEC should be adjusted accordingly and a definition of "circulation" ("putting into circulation") should be included.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) In accordance with Directive 79/373/EEC, Commission Decision 91/516/EEC(7) establishes a list of ingredients whose use is prohibited in compound feedingstuffs for reasons related to the protection of human and animal health; this ban does not, however, cover the circulation of such materials as feed materials or the use of these materials as such as feed materials by livestock farmers.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) In order to remedy this situation, it is necessary, firstly, to widen the scope of Council Directive 96/25/EC of 29 April 1996 on the circulation of feed materials, amending Directives 70/524/EEC, 74/63/EEC, 82/471/EEC and 93/74/EEC and repealing Directive 77/101/EEC(8), in order to cover the use of feed materials as well; secondly, a list of materials whose circulation or use as feed materials is prohibited or restricted should be drawn up to replace Commission Decision 91/516/EEC, so that the scope of the prohibitions or restrictions is general and applies both to the use of the feed materials as such as well as to their use in compound feedingstuffs; Council Directive 79/373/EEC should be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) Experience has shown also that certain by-products which have been subjected to industrial processes may contain substances which, although not representing a threat to animal or human health, may have an unfavourable impact on the environment; it is therefore necessary to provide also that feed materials must not represent any danger to the environment.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) Council Directive 90/667/EEC of 27 November 1990 laying down the veterinary rules for the disposal and processing of animal waste, for its placing on the market and for the prevention of pathogens in feedstuffs of animal or fish origin, and amending Directive 90/425/EEC(9), lays down the rules for the placing on the market of animal waste intended for uses other than human consumption, and Directive 96/25/EC lays down rules applying to labelling providing users with accurate information concerning the identity of the products and any restrictions on their use; there is a need to ensure that instruments relating to the veterinary sector and to animal nutrition are in perfect concordance.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) In order to provide users and control authorities with the means to verify without difficulty the origin of feed materials and their compliance with the health guarantees with regard to Directive 90/667/EEC, it is necessary to include among the indications required for those feed materials the name and address of the producing establishment, the approval number, the reference number of the batch or any other particulars that will ensure that the feed material can be traced.</p>
      <p n="20">(9) Directives 79/373/EEC and 96/25/EC should be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="21">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="22">Article 1</p>
      <p n="23">Directive 79/373/EEC is hereby amended as follows:</p>

      <p n="28">3. in Article 5d(1), the second subparagraph shall be replaced by the following:"Where other Community provisions concerning compound feedingstuffs require indication of a minimum storage life or an expiry date of guarantee, the indication referred to in the first subparagraph shall be made, giving only the earliest date.";</p>
