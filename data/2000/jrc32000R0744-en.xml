      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 744/2000</p>
      <p n="3">of 10 April 2000</p>
      <p n="4">rectifying Regulation (EEC) No 32/82 laying down the conditions for granting special export refunds for beef and veal</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 33(12) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 32/82(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2326/97(3), lays down the conditions for granting special export refunds for beef and veal.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) As a result of a drafting error, when Regulation (EEC) No 32/82 was last amended, by Regulation (EC) No 2326/97, the final sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 2(2) was deleted. That sentence should therefore be reintroduced into the text with effect from 3 December 1997, the date on which Regulation (EC) No 2326/97 entered into force.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">The following sentence is added to the second subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 32/82:"However, the competent authorities may authorise the wrapping of the products on condition that the identification mark or seal on each product, referred to in Article 3(2), still remains visible."</p>
      <p n="15">Article 2</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="17">It shall apply from 3 December 1997.</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="19">Done at Brussels, 10 April 2000.</p>
      <p n="20">For the Commission</p>
