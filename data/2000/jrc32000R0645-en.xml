      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 645/2000 of 28 March 2000 setting out detailed implementing rules necessary for the proper functioning of certain provisions of Article 7 of Council Directive 86/362/EEC and of Article 4 of Council Directive 90/642/EEC concerning the arrangements for monitoring the maximum levels of pesticide residues in and on cereals and products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables, respectively</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 645/2000</p>
      <p n="3">of 28 March 2000</p>
      <p n="4">setting out detailed implementing rules necessary for the proper functioning of certain provisions of Article 7 of Council Directive 86/362/EEC and of Article 4 of Council Directive 90/642/EEC concerning the arrangements for monitoring the maximum levels of pesticide residues in and on cereals and products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables, respectively</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/71/EC(2), and in particular Article 7 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables(3), as last amended by Directive 1999/71/EC, and in particular Article 4 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Article 7 of Directive 86/362/EEC and Article 4 of Directive 90/642/EEC respectively set out basic provisions concerning the monitoring of pesticides in and on cereals and fruit and vegetables respectively.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Experience in setting out and implementing Commission recommendations has shown that multiannual planning, with the possibility of annual adjustment, would be the most effective approach to establishing European Community coordinated monitoring programmes.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Article 7 of Directive 86/362/EEC and Article 4 of Directive 90/642/EEC provide for review and adoption of any necessary measures, such as the publication by the Commission of European Community reports containing collated and compiled information of the Member States and the adoption of action to be taken at Community level in the case of reported infringements of the maximum levels. Experience has confirmed that in order that their reported results can be used with confidence, laboratories undertaking analyses of pesticide residues must operate with high levels of quality assurance. The participation of laboratories in regular proficiency tests and their implementation of common quality control procedures, may serve to fulfil the accreditation requirements of Article 3 of Council Directive 93/99/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the subject of additional measures concerning the official control of foodstuffs(4).</p>
      <p n="13">(4) Because the Commission, in collating and compiling the information submitted by the Member States for presentation as European Community reports, must have confidence in the quality, accuracy and comparability of that information it is appropriate, that the Commission should contribute financially to actions which support the undertaking at the highest standards achievable of the monitoring programmes. In particular the regular proficiency tests of laboratories and the review and development of quality control procedure guidelines at regular specialist meetings should be supported.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) It is appropriate that the Commission should contribute financially to actions which support other aspects of the coordination of pesticide residue monitoring at Community level. In particular work should be supported to allow the Commission to respond to the requirement that it should work progressively towards a system which would permit the estimation of actual dietary exposure from monitoring data.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) The communication from the Commission on consumer health and food safety (COM(97) 183) describes the operation of the food; veterinary and phytosanitary control and inspection services. The monitoring of pesticide residues in and on cereals and fruit and vegetables is an activity which should be covered by the inspection service.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) The monitoring exercises for 1996 and 1997 demonstrated infringements of the maximum levels as laid down in Directive 90/642/EEC as amended.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) Directive 90/642/EEC, as amended, as well as Directive 86/362/EEC, as amended provide for the adoption of actions to be taken at Community level in the case of reported infringements and for detailed implementing rules necessary for the proper functioning of the monitoring.</p>
      <p n="18">(9) A summary overview of the monitoring systems in all Member States is necessary to improve the monitoring of pesticide residues in the Community and to assist in its proper functioning.</p>
      <p n="19">(10) Detailed implementing rules necessary for the proper functioning of the monitoring provisions should be made. These rules should clearly set out the actions to, and procedures by, which the Commission may make financial contributions, within the available budgetary allocations.</p>
      <p n="20">(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,</p>
      <p n="21">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

In order to permit the effective year-to-year management of multiannual monitoring programmes, the Commission may submit annual confirmatory and supplementary draft recommendations; these shall be submitted to the Standing Committee on Plant Health as provided for in Article 7(2)(b) of Directive 86/362/EEC and Article 4(2)(b) of Directive 90/642/EEC.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 2</p>

      <p n="30">(b) to the organisation of the development of quality control procedures for pesticide residue analysis, in the form of guidance notes of the Standing Committee on Plant Health, and to the organisation of the regular review, in principle at two-yearly intervals in specialist meetings, of the application of such procedures in the residue analytical laboratories of the Member States in order to assure the quality, accuracy and comparability of the information sent by the Member States to the Commission and to the other Member States annually and collated and compiled for publication by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of Article 7(3) of Directive 86/362/EEC and Article 4(3) of Directive 90/642/EEC;</p>
      <p n="31">(c) to the yearly organisation of studies, consultations and other preparations necessary to allow the Commission to work progressively towards a system which could permit the estimation of actual pesticide dietary exposure from monitoring data, as required by the second subparagraph of Article 7(3) of Directive 86/362/EEC and of Article 4(3) of Directive 90/642/EEC; and</p>
      <p n="32">(d) to the organisation of other actions at Community level necessary for the proper implementation of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 7 of Directive 86/362/EEC and of Article 4 of Directive 90/642/EEC respectively which may be identified by the Commission and the Standing Committee on Plant Health.</p>
