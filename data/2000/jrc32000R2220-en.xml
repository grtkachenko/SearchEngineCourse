      <p n="14">(5) The PHARE Multi-Beneficiary Drugs Programme aims, in particular, at providing assistance to the central and eastern European countries for the development and strengthening of information systems and networks for collecting, processing and distributing data concerning drugs and drug addiction in these countries.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) It is desirable directly to entrust the Observatory with the implementation of structural technical assistance projects in the field of information systems for the applicant countries of the central and eastern European countries and other applicant countries with a view to involving them with the activities of the Observatory and establishing structural links with the Reitox network.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) It is necessary for the Observatory to cover in its approach all PHARE countries which are part of the PHARE Multi-Beneficiary Drugs Programme, including therefore Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) The structural assistance projects to be implemented by the Observatory in applicant countries and countries eligible for the PHARE programme include in particular activities related to coordination and exchange of information, transfer of know how, creation and reinforcement of structural links with the Reitox network and setting up and consolidation of national focal points,</p>
