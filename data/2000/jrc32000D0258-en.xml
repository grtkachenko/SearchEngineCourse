      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in, and imports into, the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(1) to Directive 90/425/EEC(1), and in particular Article 10(6) thereof,</p>

      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Directive 92/65/EEC provides for an alternative system to quarantine for the entry of certain domestic carnivores into the territory of certain Member States free from rabies. That system requires checks on the effectiveness of the vaccination of those animals by titration of antibodies.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) In order to guarantee an effective system of monitoring the laboratories which will carry out these analyses, it is appropriate to establish a system of Community approval of such laboratories.</p>
      <p n="13">(3) The approval of those laboratories should be coordinated by a Community reference laboratory for those matters.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) The Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des aliments de Nancy (French Food Safety Agency, Nancy) laboratory meets the conditions required for designation as Community reference laboratory for those matters.</p>
      <p n="15">(5) That reference laboratory may receive Community aid as provided for in Article 28 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(2).</p>
      <p n="16">(6) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(3),</p>
