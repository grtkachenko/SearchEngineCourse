      <p n="3">of 12 October 2000</p>

      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(1), and in particular Article 7(5) thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Since modern financial audit methods are becoming increasingly important in the EAGGF Guarantee Section accounts clearance procedure, the conciliation body should be composed not only of members who are highly qualified in EAGGF Guarantee Section matters, but also of members with a high level of practical financial audit experience. Commission Decision 94/442/EC setting up a conciliation procedure in the context of the clearance of the accounts of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) Guarantee Section(2) should be adapted accordingly.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">Decision 94/442/EC is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="16">The first subparagraph of Article 3(1) is replaced by the following:"The Body shall be composed of five members selected from among eminent persons offering every guarantee of independence and highly qualified in EAGGF Guarantee Section matters or in the practice of financial audit. They must be nationals of different Member States."</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
