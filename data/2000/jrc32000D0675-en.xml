      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products(1), as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC(2), and in particular Article 11 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) A Commission expert has conducted an inspection visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) The provisions of legislation of the Islamic Republic of Iran on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC.</p>

      <p n="16">(5) Pursuant to Article 11(4)(b) of Directive 91/493/EEC, a mark should be affixed to packages of fishery products giving the name of the third country and the approval/registration number of the establishment, factory vessel, cold store or freezer vessel of origin.</p>

These lists must be drawn up on the basis of a communication from the IVO to the Commission. It is therefore for the IVO to ensure compliance with the provisions laid down to that end in Article 11(4) of Directive 91/493/EEC.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) The IVO has provided official assurances regarding compliance with the rules set out in Chapter V of the Annex to Directive 91/493/EEC and regarding the fulfilment of requirements equivalent to those laid down by that Directive.</p>
