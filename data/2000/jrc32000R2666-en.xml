      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000 of 5 December 2000 on assistance for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1628/96 and amending Regulations (EEC) No 3906/89 and (EEC) No 1360/90 and Decisions 97/256/EC and 1999/311/EC</head>
      <p n="2">Council Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000</p>
      <p n="3">of 5 December 2000</p>
      <p n="4">on assistance for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1628/96 and amending Regulations (EEC) No 3906/89 and (EEC) No 1360/90 and Decisions 97/256/EC and 1999/311/EC</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament(1),</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) The Community provides assistance for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Most of this Community assistance is currently provided under Council Regulation (EC) No 1628/96 of 25 July 1996 relating to aid for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (OBNOVA)(2) and under Council Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 of 18 December 1989 on economic aid to certain countries of Central and Eastern Europe (PHARE)(3). This means that the Community assistance is subject to different sets of procedures, which encumbers management. In the interests of efficiency it is therefore desirable to establish a single legal framework for this assistance, as requested by the European Council at its meeting in Helsinki on 10 and 11 December 1999. It is therefore appropriate to repeal Regulation (EC) No 1628/96 and to amend Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89. However, in order to ensure the continuity of the activities of the European Agency for Reconstruction, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1628/96 which concern the establishment and operation of the Agency should be incorporated into a new Regulation, which should enter into force on the date of that repeal.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) The European Council, meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, confirmed that its overall objective remained the fullest possible integration of the countries of the region into the political and economic mainstream of Europe and that the stabilisation and association process was the centrepiece of its policy in the Balkans.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) The European Council, meeting in Feira on 19 and 20 June 2000, recognised the countries concerned by the stabilisation and association process to be potential candidates for EU membership.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) The existing Community assistance should be expanded and redirected to adjust it to the European Union's political objectives for the region and, particularly, to contribute to the stabilisation and association process and increase the responsibility of recipient countries and entities in relation to that process.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) To that end Community assistance will be focused mainly on building up an institutional, legislative, economic and social framework directed at the values and models subscribed to by the European Union and on promoting a market economy, with due regard for priorities agreed with the partners concerned.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) A precondition for receiving assistance is that the recipients respect democratic principles, the rule of law, human and minority rights, fundamental freedoms and the principles of international law.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) The regional dimension of Community assistance should be given special attention, with a view to stepping up regional cooperation and supporting the European Union's role as a driving force within the Stability Pact.</p>
      <p n="18">(9) In view of the political situation in some areas and the nature of the various entities that have responsibility for implementing assistance there, it is desirable to provide that the assistance can be supplied in some cases directly to recipients other than the State.</p>
      <p n="19">(10) To make Community assistance more effective and ensure it is properly implemented, the Commission should adopt general guidelines, in accordance with the management procedure laid down in this Regulation, taking into account the objectives of reform of external aid.</p>
      <p n="20">(11) To promote cooperation within the region, provision should be made for the candidate countries and, on a case-by-case basis, the countries covered by the TACIS and MEDA programmes to participate in the tendering procedures and contracts.</p>
      <p n="21">(12) Provision should be made for checks and for the protection of the Community's financial interests, inter alia by enabling the Commission, including the European Fraud Prevention Office (OLAF), and the Court of Auditors to exercise their respective powers pursuant to Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities(4) and Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests(5).</p>
      <p n="22">(13) The Community assistance should be governed by a strategy framework and by annual and multiannual programming, which will be put to the management committee set up by this Regulation for an opinion. This will situate the assistance within a medium-term outlook and will make it possible to ensure that it complements and remains consistent with that of the Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).</p>
      <p n="24">(15) In the case of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, provision should be made for the Commission to be able to delegate implementation of assistance programmes to the European Agency for Reconstruction.</p>
      <p n="25">(16) In the light of the scope of this Regulation, consequent changes will need to be made to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 of 18 December 1989 on economic aid to certain countries of Central and Eastern Europe (PHARE)(7), to Council Decision 97/256/EC of 14 April 1997 granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects outside the Community (Central and Eastern European countries, Mediterranean countries, Latin American and Asian countries, South Africa, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina)(8), to Council Decision 1999/311/EC adopting the third phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (Tempus III) (2000 to 2006)(9) and to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90 of 7 May 1990 establishing a European Training Foundation(10).</p>
      <p n="26">(17) The operations covered by this Regulation are part of the Community's Western Balkans policy and are needed to implement one of the Community's objectives.</p>
      <p n="27">(18) The Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Regulation, powers other than those under Article 308,</p>
      <p n="28">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="29">Article 1</p>
      <p n="30">1. The Community shall provide assistance, hereinafter referred to as "Community assistance", to Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
      <p n="31">2. The following shall be directly eligible for Community assistance: the State, entities under United Nations jurisdiction and administration, federal, regional and local bodies, public and semi-public bodies, the social partners, organisations providing support to businesses, cooperatives, mutual societies, associations, foundations and non-governmental organisations.</p>
      <p n="32">3. Authorities established by the international community to act as the civil administration in some areas, such as the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), shall be duly consulted on implementation of the Community assistance in their areas. Any programmes or projects they implement shall be eligible for Community assistance under this Regulation, except in the case of those entities' running costs; where appropriate, such costs may draw on a grant provided under Council Regulation (EC) No 1080/2000 of 22 May 2000 on support for the United Nations Interim Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (OHR)(11).</p>
      <p n="33">4. The financial reference amount for the implementation of this programme for the period 2000 to 2006 shall be EUR 4650 million.</p>
      <p n="34">The annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial perspective.</p>
      <p n="35">Article 2</p>
      <p n="36">1. The main purpose of the Community assistance is to support participation by the recipient countries in the stabilisation and association process.</p>
      <p n="37">2. The Community assistance shall inter alia be for:</p>
      <p n="38">(a) reconstruction, aid for the return of refugees and displaced persons, and stabilisation of the region;</p>
      <p n="39">(b) the creation of an institutional and legislative framework to underpin democracy, the rule of law and human and minority rights, reconciliation and the consolidation of civil society, the independence of the media and the strengthening of legality and of measures to combat organised crime;</p>
      <p n="40">(c) sustainable economic development and market-economy-orientated economic reform;</p>
      <p n="41">(d) social development, with particular reference to poverty reduction, gender equality, education, teaching and training, and environmental rehabilitation;</p>
      <p n="42">(e) the development of closer relations among recipient countries, between them and the European Union and between them and countries which are candidates for accession to the European Union, in coordination with other instruments for cross-border, transnational and regional transboundary cooperation with non-member countries;</p>
      <p n="43">(f) fostering regional, transnational, cross-border and interregional cooperation among the recipient countries, between them and the European Union and between the recipient countries and other countries of the region.</p>
      <p n="44">3. The Community assistance shall be implemented by financing investment and institution-building programmes in accordance with the programming principles set out in the general guidelines adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 10(2).</p>
      <p n="45">Article 3</p>
      <p n="46">1. Save in exceptional, duly substantiated cases, Community assistance shall be provided as follows:</p>
      <p n="47">(a) a strategic framework ("country strategic paper"), for the period 2000 to 2006, which shall serve to set long-term objectives for assistance and priority fields of action in recipient countries. For this purpose, due account shall be taken of all relevant assessments. The strategic framework shall be revised if exceptional events so require or in the light of the results of the assessment provided for in Article 12;</p>
      <p n="48">(b) on the basis of the strategic framework referred to in point (a), multiannual indicative programmes shall be drawn up, for three-year periods, for each country receiving Community assistance. They shall reflect priorities set under the stabilisation and association process and priorities identified and agreed with the partners concerned. Such programmes shall describe the reforms to be carried out by partners in priority sectors and include an assessment of progress made in doing so. They shall give indicative amounts (overall and for each priority sector) and set out criteria for funding the programme concerned. They shall be updated each year as necessary. They may be amended in the light of experience and progress in implementing stabilisation and association agreements, particularly as regards regional cooperation;</p>
      <p n="49">(c) annual action programmes, based on the multiannual indicative programmes referred to in point (b), shall be drawn up for each country receiving Community assistance. They shall set out, as precisely as possible, for a given operational year, the aims being pursued, the fields of action and the budget provided.

      <p n="58">1. Respect for the principles of democracy and the rule of law and for human and minority rights and fundamental freedoms is an essential element for the application of this Regulation and a precondition of eligibility for Community assistance.
