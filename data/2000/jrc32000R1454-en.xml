      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999(3) lays down the regional base areas applicable under the support system for producers of certain arable crops.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1017/94 of 26 April 1994 concerning the conversion of land currently under arable crops to extensive livestock farming in Portugal(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1461/95(5), applications have been submitted for the conversion of 6884 hectares. The base area should therefore be amended.</p>

      <p n="12">(4) Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 must therefore be amended.</p>

      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">The base areas given under "Portugal" and "Netherlands" in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 are replaced by those given in the Annex hereto.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
