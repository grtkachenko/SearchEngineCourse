      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 91/141/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant-protection products on the market(1) as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/10/EC(2) and in particular Article 6(3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Directive 91/414/EEC (hereinafter "the Directive") has provided for the development of a Community list of active substances authorised for incorporation in plant-protection products.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) A dossier for the active substance RH-7281 (zoxamide) was submitted by Rohm and Haas France SA to the authorities of the United Kingdom on 2 June 1999 with a view to obtaining its inclusion in Annex I to the Directive.</p>
      <p n="13">(3) A dossier for the active substance B-41; E-187 (milbemectin) was submitted by Sankyo Company Limited to the Dutch authorities on 6 March 2000 with a view to obtaining its inclusion in Annex I to the Directive.</p>

Further, they believe that the dossier contains data and information required by Annex III to the Directive in respect of at least one plant-protection product containing the active substances concerned. Subsequently, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2), the dossiers were submitted by the applicant to the Commission and other Member States.</p>

      <p n="19">(9) Such confirmation is necessary in order to pursue the detailed examination of the dossier as well as in order to open to Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisation for plant-protection products containing this active substance in due respect of the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of the Directive, and in particular the condition to make a detailed assessment of the active substances and the plant-protection products with regard to the requirements of the Directive.</p>
      <p n="20">(10) Such Decision does not prejudice the right of the Commission to request the applicant to submit further data or information, to the rapporteur Member State concerned, in order to clarify certain points in the dossier, The submission of further data necessary to clarify the dossier shall not affect the time limit for the submission of the report referred to under recital 12.</p>
