Under Article 4(3) of that Regulation, the exchange rate to be used is the average of the exchange rates applicable during the month preceding the date of the operative event, calculated pro rata temporis.</p>

      <p n="14">(5) Under Article 6(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2700/93, the conversion rate to be applied to the amount of the advance payment in the sheepmeat sector is the average of the exchange rates applicable during the month before the first day of the marketing year in respect of which the premium is granted, calculated pro rata temporis,</p>
