      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulations (EC) No 2290/2000(1), (EC) No 2435/2000(2) and 2851/2000(3), establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Bulgaria, Romania and Poland respectively, and in particular Articles 1(3) thereof,</p>

The abovementioned tariff concessions for preserved mushrooms have been included as they stand in Regulations (EC) No 2290/2000 and (EC) No 2435/2000 as regards products originating in Bulgaria and Romania on the one hand, and they are granted subject to no limit on quantity by Regulation (EC) No 2851/2000 as regards products originating in Poland on the other hand. Regulation (EC) No 2125/95 should accordingly be amended to strike out any reference to Poland, except the reference in Article 5 relating to licence applications by traditional importers, in order to adapt it to those new provisions.</p>
