      <p n="81">DETERMINATION OF THE TOTAL WATER CONTENT OF POULTRY CUTS</p>
      <p n="82">(Chemical test)</p>
      <p n="83">1. Object and scope</p>
      <p n="84">This method shall be used to determine the total water content of certain poultry cuts. The method shall involve determination of the water and protein contents of samples from the homogenised poultry cuts. The total water content as determined shall be compared with the limit value given by the formulae indicated in paragraph 6.4, to determine whether or not excess water has been taken up during processing. If the analyst suspects the presence of any substance which may interfere with the assessment, it shall be for him or her to take the necessary appropriate precautions.</p>
      <p n="85">2. Definitions and sampling procedures</p>
      <p n="86">The definitions given in Article 1(2) are applicable to the poultry cuts referred to in Article 14b. The sample sizes should be at least as follows:</p>
      <p n="87">chicken breast, chicken breast fillet: half of the (deboned) breast</p>
      <p n="88">turkey breast, turkey breast fillet and deboned leg meat: portions of about 100 g</p>
      <p n="89">other cuts: as defined in Article 1(2).</p>
      <p n="90">In the case of frozen or quick frozen bulk products (cuts not individually packed) the large packs from which samples are to be taken may be kept at 0 ¬∞C until individual cuts can be removed.</p>
      <p n="91">3. Principle</p>
      <p n="92">Water and protein contents shall be determined in accordance with recognised ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation) methods or other methods or analysis approved by the Council.</p>
      <p n="93">The highest permissible total water content of the poultry cuts will be estimated from the protein content of the cuts, which can be related to the physiological water content.</p>
      <p n="94">4. Apparatus and reagents</p>
      <p n="95">4.1. Scales for weighing the cuts and wrappings, capable of weighing with an accuracy better than +- 1 g.</p>
      <p n="96">4.2. Meat axe or saw for cutting cuts into pieces of appropriate size for the mincer.</p>
      <p n="97">4.3. Heavy-duty mincing machine and blender capable of homogenising poultry cuts or parts thereof.</p>
      <p n="98">Note:</p>
      <p n="99">No special mincer shall be recommended. It should have sufficient power to mince also frozen or quick-frozen meat and bones to produce a homogeneous mixture corresponding to that obtained from a mincer fitted with a 4 mm hole disc.</p>
      <p n="100">4.4. Apparatus as specified in ISO 1442, for the determination of water content.</p>
      <p n="101">4.5. Apparatus as specified in ISO 937, for the determination of protein content.</p>
      <p n="102">5. Procedure</p>
      <p n="103">5.1. Five cuts shall be taken at random from the quantity of poultry cuts to be checked and in each case kept frozen or refrigerated as the case may be until analysis in accordance with points 5.2 to 5.6 begins.</p>
      <p n="104">Samples from frozen or quick-frozen bulk products referred to under point 2 may be kept at 0 ¬∞C until analysis begins.</p>
      <p n="105">It may be conducted either as an analysis of each of the five cuts, or as an analysis of a composite sample of the five cuts.</p>
      <p n="106">5.2. The preparation shall be commenced within the hour following the removal of the cuts from the freezer or refrigerator.</p>
      <p n="107">5.3. (a) The outside of the pack shall be wiped to remove superficial ice and water. Each cut shall be weighed and removed from any wrapping material. After cutting up the cuts into smaller pieces, the weight of the poultry cut shall be determined to the nearest gram after deduction of the weight of any wrapping material removed to give "P1".</p>
      <p n="108">(b) In the case of a composite sample analysis, the total weight of the five cuts, prepared in accordance with 5.3(a), shall be determined to give "P5".</p>
      <p n="109">5.4. (a) The whole cut of which the weight is P1, shall be minced in a mincer as specified under point 4.3 (and, if necessary, mixed with the use of a blender as well) to obtain a homogeneous material from which a sample representative of each cut may then be taken.</p>
      <p n="110">(b) In the case of a composite sample analysis, all five cuts of which the weight is P5 shall be minced in a mincer as specified under point 4.3 (and, if necessary, mixed with the use of a blender as well) to obtain a homogeneous material from which two samples representative of the five cuts may then be taken.</p>
      <p n="111">The two samples are to be analysed as described in points 5.5 and 5.6.</p>
      <p n="112">5.5. A sample of the homogenised material shall be taken and used immediately to determine the water content in accordance with ISO 1442 to give the water content "a %".</p>
      <p n="113">5.6. A sample of the homogenised material shall also be taken and used immediately to determine the nitrogen content in accordance with ISO 937. This nitrogen content shall be converted to crude protein content "b %" by multiplying it by the factor 6,25.</p>
      <p n="114">6. Calculation of results</p>
      <p n="115">6.1. (a) The weight of water (W) in each cut shall be given by aP1/100 and the weight of protein (RP) by bP1/100, both of which are to be expressed in grams.</p>
      <p n="116">The sums of the weights of water (W5) and the weights of protein (RP5) in the five cuts analysed shall be determined.</p>
      <p n="117">(b) In the case of a composite sample analysis, the average content of water and protein from the two samples analysed shall be determined to give a % and b %, respectively. The weight of the water (W5) in the five cuts shall be given by aP5/100, and the weight of protein (RP5) by bP5/100, both of which are to be expressed in grams.</p>
      <p n="118">6.2. The average weight of water (WA) and protein (RPA) shall be calculated by dividing W5 and RP5 respectively, by five.</p>
      <p n="119">6.3. The mean physiological W/RP ratio as determined by this method is as follows:</p>
      <p n="120">- chicken breast fillet: 3,19 +- 0,12</p>
      <p n="121">- chicken legs and leg quarters: 3,78 +- 0,19</p>
      <p n="122">- turkey breast fillet: 3,05 +- 0,15</p>
      <p n="123">- turkey legs: 3,58 +- 0,15</p>
      <p n="124">- deboned turkey leg meat: 3,65 +- 0,17.</p>
      <p n="125">6.4. Assuming that the minimum technically unavoidable water content absorbed during preparation amounts to 2 %, 4 % or 6 %(1) depending on the type of products and chilling methods applied, the highest permissible W/RP ratio as determined by this method shall be as follows:</p>
      <p n="126">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="127">If the average WA/RPA ratio of the five cuts as calculated from the values under point 6.2 does not exceed the ratio given in point 6.4, the quantity of poultry cuts subjected to the check shall be considered up to standard.</p>
      <p n="128">(1) Calculated on the basis of the cut, exclusive of absorbed extraneous water. For (skinless) fillet and deboned turkey leg meat, the percentage is 2 % for each of the chilling methods."</p>
