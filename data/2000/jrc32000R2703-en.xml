The new decree replaces the previous one to take account of a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92, by decision of 17 November 2000 the Commission decided not to apply the Article 6 procedure, considering the amendments to be minor.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) The amendments have also been found to comply with Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92. As a result, they should be registered and published,</p>
