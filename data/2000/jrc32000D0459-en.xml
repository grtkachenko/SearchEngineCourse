      <p n="16">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="18">(1) Article 8 of the Decision of the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 8 April 1965 on the provisional location of certain institutions and departments of the Communities(1) provided for an Office for Official Publications of the European Communities (hereinafter "the Office") to be located in Luxembourg. That provision was implemented by Decision 69/13/Euratom, ECSC, EEC(2), as amended by Decision 80/443/EEC, Euratom, ECSC(3).</p>
      <p n="19">(2) The Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities(4), at last amended by Council Regulation (EC, ECSC, Euratom) No 2779/98(5), lays down specific provisions regarding the functioning of the Office.</p>
      <p n="20">(3) The rules governing the Office need to be adapted to take account of change practices in terms of the powers conferred on the appointing authority.</p>
      <p n="21">(4) There have been major technological advances in publishing, which need to be taken into account in the way the Office operates.</p>
      <p n="22">(5) Decision 69/13/Euratom, ECSC, EEC has been amended substantially. With fresh amendments being made, the Decision should be recast for the sake of clarity,</p>
      <p n="23">HAVE DECIDED:</p>
      <p n="24">Article 1</p>
      <p n="25">The task of the "Office for Official Publications of the European Communities" (the Office) shall be to publish the publications of the institutions of the European Communities and their departments under optimum technical and financial conditions, operating under the responsibility of those institutions.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 2</p>
      <p n="27">For the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions apply:</p>

      <p n="37">3. The institutions, bodies, offices and agencies may, in exceptional circumstances, publish publications otherwise than through the Office if its involvement would appreciably increase costs or where, for technical reasons, it is unable to meet the urgent requirements involved in producing and distributing a publication to a very short deadline. In this case they shall inform the Management Committee without delay.</p>
      <p n="38">4. Performance of the Office's tasks shall include the following:</p>

      <p n="72">(e) to decide unanimously whether, and in what circumstances, publications originating outside the institutions can be accommodated in the Official Journal. This provision shall not, however, apply to publications made pursuant to Community legislation;</p>
