      <head n="1">Decision No 1753/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 2000 establishing a scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars</head>
      <p n="2">Decision No 1753/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 22 June 2000</p>
      <p n="4">establishing a scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">After consulting the committee of the Regions,</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), and in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 9 March 2000,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) The ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is to achieve stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level such as to avoid the risk of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The Kyoto Protocol to that Framework Convention agreed at the December 1997 Kyoto Conference makes provision for a reduction in the level of greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Community has accepted the target of reducing its emissions during the period 2008 to 2012 in respect of a series of greenhouse gases by 8 % relative to 1990 levels.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The Kyoto Protocol requires the Parties referred to in Annex I to the Protocol to have made demonstrable progress in achieving their commitments by 2005.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) Decision 93/389/EEC(4) established a mechanism to monitor Community emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) In recognition of the importance of passenger cars as a source of CO2 emissions, the Commission has proposed a Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and to improve fuel economy. In its Conclusions of 25 June 1996 the Council welcomed the Commission's approach.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) The European Parliament and the Council have formulated an objective of 120 g/km (5 litres/100 km for petrol engines and 4,5 litres/100 km for diesel engines) as a mean value for CO2 emissions in 2005 (2010 at the latest).</p>
      <p n="18">(7) The Commission is in the process of carrying out studies aimed at drawing up, as soon as possible, appropriate proposals on harmonised procedures for measuring the specific CO2 emissions from vehicles of category N1 pursuant to Annex II to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(5).</p>
      <p n="19">(8) The specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars are measured on a harmonised basis in the Community according to the methodology laid down in Council Directive 80/1268/EEC of 16 December 1980 relating to the carbon dioxide emissions and the fuel consumption of motor vehicles(6).</p>
      <p n="20">(9) It is necessary to establish objective procedures to monitor the specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars sold throughout the Community in order to verify the effectiveness of the Community strategy, as referred to in the Commission communication of 20 December 1995, as well as the implementation of commitments formally undertaken by car manufacturers' organisations. This Decision will provide such a scheme. The Commission has announced that it will consider as soon as possible the need for a legal framework for the agreements to be entered into in the future with the car manufacturers' organisations including measures to be taken in the event of the failure of such agreements to work.</p>
      <p n="21">(10) For the purpose of this Decision, only official data that is consistent with Directive 70/156/EEC should be collected by the Member States.</p>
      <p n="22">(11) Directive 70/156/EEC provides that manufacturers are to issue a certificate of conformity which must accompany each new passenger car and that Member States are to permit the registration and entry into service of a new passenger car only if it is accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity.</p>
      <p n="23">(12) This Decision is not intended to harmonise national vehicle registration systems but to build on them in order to ensure the compilation of a minimum set of data required to allow the proper functioning of a Community scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars.</p>
      <p n="24">(13) It is desirable to include all new alternatively powered passenger cars which fall within the scope of Directive 70/156/EEC.</p>
      <p n="25">(14) Such a monitoring scheme should only apply to those new passenger cars which are to be registered for the first time in the Community and have not been registered previously elsewhere.</p>
      <p n="26">(15) It is necessary to maintain contacts between the Commission and Member States as regards the control of quality of data in order to assure an adequate implementation of this Decision,</p>
      <p n="27">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>

      <p n="109">ANNEX I</p>
      <p n="110">Data to be collected and transmitted by the Member States for the purposes of a CO2 monitoring scheme for new passenger cars</p>
      <p n="111">With regard to the operation of a Community-wide scheme to monitor the specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars, Member States will collect a minimum amount of information for each new passenger car that is registered in the Community for the first time. Only fuels and propulsion systems included in Community type-approval legislation are to be considered.</p>
      <p n="112">The following data will be collected and stored by the Member States when a new passenger car is registered for the first time in the Community:</p>
      <p n="113">- specific emissions of CO2 (g/km)</p>
      <p n="114">- fuel type (e.g. petrol, diesel)</p>
      <p n="115">- manufacturer</p>
      <p n="116">- mass (kg)</p>
      <p n="117">- maximum net power (kW)</p>
      <p n="118">- engine capacity (cm3).</p>
      <p n="119">ANNEX II</p>
      <p n="120">Data quality and accuracy</p>
      <p n="121">1. Introduction</p>
      <p n="122">Manufacturers may differentiate their passenger car types into variants and further still into versions. For any given car the most accurate CO2 emissions data are those cited for the particular version to which the car belongs. For the purposes of the monitoring scheme Member States should collect, therefore, only "version-specific" data.</p>
      <p n="123">2. Use of type-approval documentation as the source of monitoring data</p>
      <p n="124">(a) Information that is to be used for CO2/cars monitoring purposes (or to be included in electronic databases for subsequent use in a CO2/cars monitoring scheme) must be extracted from the official "information package" accompanying the notification of the granting of type-approval as circulated by the national type-approval authorities in the Member States and as laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC.</p>
      <p n="125">(b) The information package circulated by national type-approval authorities may contain data specific to several different versions. It is important, therefore, that the appropriate data for a new passenger car covered by the provisions of this Decision are correctly identified in the information package. The data for a specific version will, therefore, be selected on the basis of the vehicle's "type", "variant" and "version" numbers as they appear on the certificate of conformity. The certificate of conformity necessarily contains data relating to a specific version of a given car type.</p>
      <p n="126">3. Potential sources of error</p>
      <p n="127">(a) Extraction of version specific data from type-approval documentation</p>
      <p n="128">There are two important potential sources of error associated with the use of type-approval documentation as the source of monitoring data for the purposes of this Decision. The first may arise in the conversion of data contained in a paper format in the information folder into an electronic format for use in a database of type-approval data. This is most likely to arise from human error. The second concerns the correct extraction of data from electronic databases of type-approval data. Data for the correct version should be identified in such databases by the unique combination of type, variant and version numbers given on the certificate of conformity.</p>
      <p n="129">(b) Transfer of data from the certificate of conformity into an electronic registration file</p>
      <p n="130">When data are taken from the certificate of conformity (paper) and entered into an electronic registration file during the registration of a new passenger car there is a risk that incorrect data might be entered. The most likely source is human error.</p>
      <p n="131">(c) Automated transfer of data by the manufacturers to registration authorities</p>
      <p n="132">In some Member States manufacturers are asked to transfer data contained in the certificate of conformity to the registration authorities (or directly into registration files) by electronic means. There is of course a possibility that incorrect data are transferred and the systems should, therefore, be validated.</p>
      <p n="133">ANNEX III</p>
      <p n="134">Methodology for determining the CO2 monitoring information for new passenger cars</p>
      <p n="135">This Annex describes the monitoring information that is to be communicated to the Commission. The monitoring information is to be generated from the raw data collected during the first registration of new passenger cars (described in Annex I) according to the methods described below. The precise format in which this information should be communicated to the Commission is described in Annex IV.</p>
      <p n="136">Only fuels and propulsion systems included in Community type-approval legislation are to be considered at the current time. Only information regarding new passenger cars which have not been registered previously within the Community are to be included in this monitoring scheme. Passenger cars which have been registered previously within the Community or elsewhere are specifically excluded from the previsions of this Decision.</p>
      <p n="137">1. Numbers of newly registered passenger cars differentiated by fuel type (Nf)</p>
      <p n="138">For each separate fuel type (e.g. petrol and diesel) Member States will determine the number of new passenger cars which have been registered for the first time within their territory. For each fuel type, f, the number of new passenger cars registered for the first time is represented as Nf.</p>
      <p n="139">2. Average specific CO2 emissions of newly registered cars of a given fuel type (Sf,ave)</p>
      <p n="140">The specific CO2 emission averaged over all newly registered cars of a given fuel type, (designated by Sf,ave) is calculated from the sum of the specific CO2 emissions of each individual newly registered car of a particular fuel type, Sf, divided by the number of newly registered cars of the same fuel type, Nf:</p>
      <p n="141">&gt;PIC FILE= "L_2000202EN.000702.EPS"&gt;</p>
      <p n="142">3. The distribution of CO2 emissions from new passenger cars</p>
      <p n="143">The number of newly registered passenger cars of each fuel type which fall into each of the following CO2 emission categories is to be recorded. The CO2 emission categories are &lt; 60, 60-80, 81-100, 101-120, 121-140, 141-160, 161-180, 181-200, 201-250, 251-300, 301-350, 351-450, &gt; 450 g/km.</p>
