      <p n="8">THE CONTRACTING PARTIES,</p>
      <p n="9">DESIRING to develop and maintain the protection of the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works in a manner as effective and uniform as possible,</p>
      <p n="10">RECOGNISING the need to introduce new international rules and clarify the interpretation of certain existing rules in order to provide adequate solutions to the questions raised by new economic, social, cultural and technological developments,</p>
      <p n="11">RECOGNISING the profound impact of the development and convergence of information and communication technologies on the creation and use of literary and artistic works,</p>
      <p n="12">EMPHASISING the outstanding significance of copyright protection as an incentive for literary and artistic creation,</p>
      <p n="13">RECOGNISING the need to maintain a balance between the rights of authors and the larger public interest, particularly education, research and access to information, as reflected in the Berne Convention,</p>
      <p n="14">HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">Relation to the Berne Convention</p>
      <p n="17">1. This Treaty is a special agreement within the meaning of Article 20 of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, as regards Contracting Parties that are countries of the Union established by that Convention. This Treaty shall not have any connection with treaties other than the Berne Convention, nor shall it prejudice any rights and obligations under any other treaties.</p>
      <p n="18">2. Nothing in this Treaty shall derogate from existing obligations that Contracting Parties have to each other under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.</p>
      <p n="19">3. Hereinafter, "Berne Convention" shall refer to the Paris Act of July 24, 1971, of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.</p>
      <p n="20">4. Contracting Parties shall comply with Articles 1 to 21 and the Appendix of the Berne Convention.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>

      <p n="25">Application of Articles 2 to 6 of the Berne Convention</p>

      <p n="30">Article 5</p>
      <p n="31">Compilations of data (databases)</p>
      <p n="32">Compilations of data or other material, in any form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations, are protected as such. This protection does not extend to the data or the material itself and is without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material contained in the compilation.</p>
      <p n="33">Article 6</p>
      <p n="34">Right of distribution</p>
      <p n="35">1. Authors of literary and artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorising the making available to the public of the original and copies of their works through sale or other transfer of ownership.</p>
      <p n="36">2. Nothing in this Treaty shall affect the freedom of Contracting Parties to determine the conditions, if any, under which the exhaustion of the right in paragraph 1 applies after the first sale or other transfer of ownership of the original or a copy of the work with the authorisation of the author.</p>
      <p n="37">Article 7</p>
      <p n="38">Right of rental</p>

      <p n="42">(iii) works embodied in phonograms, as determined in the national law of Contracting Parties;</p>
      <p n="43">shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorising commercial rental to the public of the originals or copies of their works.</p>
      <p n="44">2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply:</p>
      <p n="45">(i) in the case of computer programs, where the program itself is not the essential object of the rental; and</p>
      <p n="46">(ii) in the case of cinematographic works, unless such commercial rental has led to widespread copying of such works materially impairing the exclusive right of reproduction.</p>
      <p n="47">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, a Contracting Party that, on April 15, 1994, had and continues to have in force a system of equitable remuneration of authors for the rental of copies of their works embodied in phonograms may maintain that system provided that the commercial rental of works embodied in phonograms is not giving rise to the material impairment of the exclusive right of reproduction of authors.</p>

      <p n="49">Right of communication to the public</p>
      <p n="50">Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 11(1)(ii), 11bis(1)(i) and (ii), 11ter(1)(ii), 14(1)(ii) and 14bis(1) of the Berne Convention, authors of literary and artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorising any communication to the public of their works, by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access these works from a place and at at time individually chosen by them.</p>

      <p n="59">Obligations concerning technological measures</p>
      <p n="60">Contracting Parties shall provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by authors in connection with the exercise of their rights under this Treaty or the Berne Convention and that restrict acts, in respect of their works, which are not authorised by the authors concerned or permitted by law.</p>
      <p n="61">Article 12</p>

      <p n="123">Agreed statements</p>
      <p n="124">Concerning Article 1(4)</p>
      <p n="125">The reproduction right, as set out in Article 9 of the Berne Convention, and the exceptions permitted thereunder, fully apply in the digital environment, in particular to the use of works in digital form. It is understood that the storage of a protected work in digital form in an electronic medium constitutes a reproduction within the meaning of Article 9 of the Berne Convention.</p>
      <p n="126">Concerning Article 3</p>
      <p n="127">It is understood that, in applying Article 3 of this Treaty, the expression "Country of the Union" in Articles 2 to 6 of the Berne Convention will be read as if it were a reference to a Contracting Party to this Treaty, in the application of those Berne Articles in respect of protection provided for in this Treaty. It is also understood that the expression "country outside the Union" in those Articles in the Berne Convention will, in the same circumstances, be read as if it were a referance to a country that is not a Contracting Party to this Treaty, and that "this Convention" in Articles 2(8). 2bis(2). 3. 4 and 5 of the Berne Convention will be read as if it were a reference to the Berne Convention and this Treaty. Finally, it is understood that a reference in Articles 3 to 6 of the Berne Convention to a "national of one of the countries of the Union" will, when these Articles are applied to this Treaty, mean, in regard to an intergovernmental organisation that is a Contracting Party to this Treaty, a national of one of the countries that is member of that organisation.</p>
      <p n="128">Concerning Article 4</p>
      <p n="129">The scope of protection for computer programs under Article 4 of this Treaty, read with Article 2, is consistent with Article 2 of the Berne Convention and on a par with the relevant provisions of the TRIPS Agreement.</p>
      <p n="130">Concerning Article 5</p>
      <p n="131">The scope of protection for compilations of data (databases) under Article 5 of this Treaty, read with Article 2, is consistent with Article 2 of the Berne Convention and on a par with the relevant provisions of the TRIPS Agreement.</p>
      <p n="132">Concerning Articles 6 and 7</p>
      <p n="133">As used in these Articles, the expressions "copies" and "original and copies" being subject to the right of distribution and the right of rental under the said Articles, refer exclusively to fixed copies that can be put into circulation as tangible objects.</p>
      <p n="134">Concerning Article 7</p>
      <p n="135">It is understood that the obligation under Article 7(1) does not require a Contracting Party to provide an exclusive right of commercial rental to authors who, under that Contracting Party's law, are not granted rights in respect of phonograms. It is understood that this obligation is consistent with Article 14(4) of the TRIPS Agreement.</p>
      <p n="136">Concerning Article 8</p>
      <p n="137">It is understood that the mere provision of physical facilities for enabling or making a communication does not in itself amount to communication within the meaning of this Treaty or the Berne Convention. It is further understood that nothing in Article 8 percludes a Contracting Party from applying Article 11bis(2).</p>
      <p n="138">Concerning Article 10</p>
      <p n="139">It is understood that the provisions of Article 10 permit Contracting Parties to carry forward and appropriately extend into the digital environment limitations and exceptions in their national laws which have been considered acceptable under the Berne Convention. Similarly, these provisions should be understood to permit Contracting Parties to devise new exceptions and limitations that are appropriate in the digital network environment.</p>
      <p n="140">It is also understood that Article 10(2) neither reduces nor extends the scope of applicability of the limitations and exceptions permitted by the Berne Convention.</p>
      <p n="141">Concerning Article 12</p>
      <p n="142">It is understood that the referance to "infringement of any right coverd by this Treaty or the Berne Convention" includes both exclusive rights and rights of remuneration.</p>
      <p n="143">It is further understood that Contracting Parties will not rely on this Article ot devise or implement rights management systems that would have the effect of imposing formalities which are not permitted under the Berne Convention or this Treaty, prohibiting the free movement of goods or impeding the enjoyment of rights under this Treaty.</p>
