      <head n="1">Council Common Position of 20 November 2000 amending Common Position 96/184/CFSP concerning arms exports to the former Yugoslavia</head>
      <p n="2">Council Common Position</p>
      <p n="3">of 20 November 2000</p>
      <p n="4">amending Common Position 96/184/CFSP concerning arms exports to the former Yugoslavia</p>
      <p n="5">(2000/722/CFSP)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) On 26 February 1996 the Council adopted Common Position 96/184/CFSP concerning arms exports to the former Yugoslavia(1), which was amended by Decisions 98/498/CFSP(2) and 99/481/CFSP(3).</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The Council has concluded that developments in Croatia, in particular its undertaking to apply in full the Dayton/Paris Αgreements and its policy with regard to arms exports, justifies a lifting of the restrictive measures taken against that State pursuant to Common Position 96/184/CFSP.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) It is understood that, with respect to arms exports to Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Member States will apply strictly the European Union Code of Conduct for arms exports adopted on 8 June 1998,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS COMMON POSITION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">Common Position 96/184/CFSP is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="15">1. the word "Croatia" in point 2(i) shall be deleted;</p>
      <p n="16">2. point 2(ii), shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="17">"(ii) Subject to the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution No 1021, export licence applications to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to Croatia shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p n="18">This provision is adopted on the understanding that the Member States will apply strictly the European Union Code of Conduct for arms exports adopted on 8 June 1998. They will also take into account the objectives of the European Union policy in the region, fundamentally aimed at pacification and stabilisation in the area, including the need for arms control and reduction to the lowest possible level and confidence-building measures."</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">This Common Position shall take effect on the day of its adoption.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 3</p>
      <p n="22">This Common Position shall be published in the Official Journal.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 20 November 2000.</p>
      <p n="24">For the Council</p>
      <p n="25">The President</p>
      <p n="26">H. Védrine</p>
      <p n="27">(1) OJ L 58, 7.3.1996, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="28">(2) OJ L 225, 12.8.1998, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="29">(3) OJ L 188, 21.7.1999, p. 3.</p>
