      <p n="78">PREPARATORY WORK</p>
      <p n="79">(Procedure to be followed before requesting the Commission to initiate the procedure for setting the ecological criteria for product groups)</p>
      <p n="80">26. The EUEB may request the Commission to initiate the procedure for setting the ecological criteria for product groups.</p>
      <p n="81">27. The EUEB shall take due account of the Community Eco-label working plan referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, and in particular the nonexhaustive list of product groups considered as priorities for Community action.</p>
      <p n="82">28. The EUEB shall carry out preparatory work to determine whether the product group under consideration falls within the scope of the Community Eco-label award scheme as laid down in Article 2 of the said Regulation, and in particular satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 2(2). The Commission may also request the EUEB to carry out this preparatory work.</p>
      <p n="83">29. In order to carry out this preparatory work, the EUEB shall select a lead competent body or bodies willing to take a lead role, who shall form an ad hoc working group. The general rules detailed above shall apply.</p>

      <p n="86">(a) analysing the nature of the market, including the industrial and economic segmentation of the sector (main manufacturers, market shares, imports, etc.), characterising the different types of the product, analysing the possibilities of successfully marketing the Eco-labelled products, and proposing an appropriate marketing and communication strategy;</p>
      <p n="87">(b) seeking the opinion of all interested parties (competent bodies, interest groups, etc.), and identifying those parties that would cooperate in the process of establishing criteria;</p>
      <p n="88">(c) analysing the key environmental impacts, the environmental best practice in the sector, looking also at design for environment issues, and identifying the major areas for improvement of the product group and how these might feasibly be addressed in ecological criteria;</p>
      <p n="89">(d) analysing the key elements relating to the product's fitness in meeting the needs of consumers and how these might feasibly be addressed in Eco-label criteria;</p>
      <p n="90">(e) making an inventory and obtaining copies of existing Eco-labels, standards, test methods and studies that are relevant for the establishment of an Eco-label for the product group, taking into account the work done on related product groups, and estimating the costs of testing;</p>

This final report shall be made available in both printed and electronic format, and shall be made open for consultation, if possible on the Eco-label web-site. It shall inlude in annex a summary list of all documents circulated in the course of this work, together with an indication of the date of circulation of each document and to whom it has been circulated, and a copy of the documents in question. It shall also include in annex a list of the interested parties involved in the work or that have been consulted or have expressed an opinion, together with their contact information. It shall include an executive summary and where relevant annexes with detailed inventory computations. Any observations received on the report will be taken into consideration, and, upon request, information on the followup to the comments will be provided.</p>

      <p n="96">31. When satisfied with the above preparatory work for a candidate product group and with the positive recommendation of the ad hoc working group, the EUEB shall forward the final report together with the proposals concerning the drafting of the mandate to the Commission, and shall request the Commission to initiate the procedure for setting the ecological criteria for the product group in question and to give a mandate to the EUEB that takes into account the abovementioned proposals. The members of the EUEB representing the interested parties referred to in Article 15 of the said Regulation may individually or collectively annex their specific opinion or opinions to this final report.</p>
      <p n="97">MANDATE TO DEVELOP OR REVISE CRITERIA</p>
