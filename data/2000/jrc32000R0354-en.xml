      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) On 7 December 1999 China made an official request to be allowed to import certain waste listed in Annex II to Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 without any control procedures, instead of applying the control procedure applicable to waste listed in Annex IV to that Regulation.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) In accordance with Article 17(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 259/93, the committee instituted by Article 18 of Council Directive 75/442 of 15 July 1975 on waste(3), as last amended by Commission Decision 96/350/EC(4), was notified of the official request on 13 December 1999.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) In order to take account of China's new situation, it is necessary to amend Commission Regulation (EC) No 1547/1999 of 12 July 1999 determining the control procedures to apply, in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93, to shipments of certain types of waste to certain countries to which OECD Decision C(92)39 final does not apply(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 334/2000(6),</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">Annex D to Regulation (EC) No 1547/1999 is amended by adding the following types of waste to the Chapter "CHINA":</p>
      <p n="16">1. All types included in section GH (Solid plastic waste).</p>
      <p n="17">2. In section GJ (Textile wastes):</p>
      <p n="18">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
