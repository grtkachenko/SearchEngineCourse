      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1552/2000</p>
      <p n="3">of 14 July 2000</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 1547/1999 concerning the control procedures to apply to shipments of certain types of waste to: Estonia, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Lithuania, San Marino and Thailand</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community(1), as last amended by Commission Decision 1999/816/EC(2), and in particular Article 17(3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) In January, the European Commission sent a "note verbale" to all non-OECD countries (plus Hungary and Poland which do not yet apply OECD Decision C(92)39 final). The purpose of this "note verbale" was threefold: (i) to inform these countries of the Community's new regulations; (ii) to ask for confirmation of the respective positions as outlined in the annexes of both regulations; and (iii) to have an answer from those countries which did not reply in 1994.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Among the countries that replied, the following notified the Commission that the import of certain wastes listed in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 is accepted either without any control procedure or is subject to control pursuant to the control procedure which applies to Annexes III or IV to the said Regulation:</p>
      <p n="12">1. Estonia (reply of 10 February 2000),</p>
      <p n="13">2. Hong Kong (reply of 25 February 2000),</p>
      <p n="14">3. Hungary (reply of 9 February 2000),</p>
      <p n="15">4. Indonesia (reply of 15 Feburary 2000 and further details given on 14 April 2000),</p>
      <p n="16">5. Lithuania (reply of 15 February 2000),</p>
      <p n="17">6. San Marino (reply of 14 February 2000),</p>
      <p n="18">7. Thailand (reply of 17 February 2000).</p>
      <p n="19">(3) In accordance with Article 17(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 259/93, the committee instituted by Article 18 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste(3), as last amended by Commission Decision 96/350/EC(4), was notified of the official request of these countries on 26 April 2000.</p>
      <p n="20">(4) In order to take into account the new situation of these countries, it is necessary to amend Commission Regulation (EC) No 1547/1999 of 12 July 1999 determining the control procedures under Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 to apply to to shipments of certain types of waste to certain countries to which OECD Decision C(92)39 final does not apply(5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1208/2000(6),</p>
