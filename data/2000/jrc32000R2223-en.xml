      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2223/2000</p>
      <p n="3">of 6 October 2000</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EEC) No 65/82 laying down detailed rules for carrying forward sugar to the following marketing year</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 of 13 September 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1527/2000(2), and in particular Article 32(4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) The second subparagraph of Article 32(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 allows a sugar-producing undertaking to carry forward to the following marketing year, for treatment as part of that year's production, all or part of its production of A and B sugar which has become C sugar following the application of the reduction mechanism laid down in Article 26(5) of that Regulation.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The detailed rules of application laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 65/82(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 260/96(4), govern the carry-forward referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 32(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999. While the rules cover the conditions applying to the new option of carrying forward C sugar, some clarifications are nonetheless needed to take account of the fact that this carry-forward is not subject to the quantity restriction to in Article 32(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999. Regulation (EEC) No 65/82 must be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,</p>

      <p n="14">Regulation (EEC) No 65/82 is amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="15">1. The second subparagraph of Article 2(1) is replaced by the following text:"In the case of the carry-forward referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 32(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999, this decision by the undertaking may apply only up to a maximum quantity not exceeding 20 % of its A quota applicable in the marketing year during which the sugar in question was produced."</p>
      <p n="16">2. Article 4(1)(b) is replaced by the following text:</p>
      <p n="17">"(b) the quantity, expressed as white sugar, of B or C sugar to be carried forward, allocated as appropriate between:</p>
      <p n="18">- the carry-forward under the first subparagraph of Article 32(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999,</p>
      <p n="19">- the carry-forward under the second subparagraph of Article 32(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999."</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 6 October 2000.</p>
      <p n="24">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="25">Franz Fischler</p>
      <p n="26">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="27">(1) OJ L 252, 25.9.1999, p. 1.</p>
