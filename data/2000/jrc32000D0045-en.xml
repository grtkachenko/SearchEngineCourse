      <p n="32">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="33">(1) OJ L 99, 11.4.1992, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="34">(2) OJ L 191, 1.8.1996, p. 56.</p>
      <p n="35">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="36">CRITERIA</p>
      <p n="37">FRAMEWORK</p>
      <p n="38">In order to qualify for an eco-label, the product as defined in Article 1 must comply with the criteria of this Annex. Where appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body assessing the application.</p>
      <p n="39">The competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14 001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex (Note: it is not required to implement such management schemes.)</p>
      <p n="40">These criteria aim in particular at promoting:</p>
      <p n="41">- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of energy (global warming, acidification, depletion of non-renewable resources) by reducing energy consumption</p>
      <p n="42">- the reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by reducing water consumption</p>
      <p n="43">- the reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by encouraging recyclability</p>
      <p n="44">- the reduction of water pollution by contributing to reduced detergent consumption, and</p>
      <p n="45">- the reduction of noise emissions.</p>
      <p n="46">The criteria encourage the implementation of best practice and enhance consumer environmental awareness. Furthermore, marking the plastic components encourages the recycling of the machine.</p>
      <p n="47">KEY CRITERIA</p>
      <p n="48">1. Energy efficiency</p>
      <p n="49">The machine shall use less than or equal to 0,17 kWh of electrical energy per kg of washload measured according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Commission Directive 95/12/EC(1).</p>
      <p n="50">The applicant shall provide a copy of the technical documentation referred to under Article 2(1) of Directive 95/12/EC. This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of energy consumption made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC. The arithmetic mean of these measurements shall be less or equal to the above requirement. The value declared on the energy label shall not be lower than this mean value, and the energy efficiency class indicated on the energy label shall correspond to this mean value.</p>
      <p n="51">In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 60456:1999.</p>
      <p n="52">2. Water consumption</p>
      <p n="53">The machine shall use less than or equal to 12 litres of water per kg of washload measured according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.</p>
      <p n="54">The applicant shall provide a copy of the technical documentation referred to under Article 2(1) of Directive 95/12/EC. This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of water consumption made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC. The arithmetic mean of these measurements shall be less or equal to the above requirement. The value declared on the energy label shall not be lower than this mean value.</p>
      <p n="55">In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 6056:1999.</p>
