      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant-protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/80/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>

Subsequently, in accordance with Article 6(2), the applicant submitted the dossier to the Commission and other Member States.</p>

      <p n="16">(6) Such confirmation is necessary to permit a detailed examination of the dossier and to allow Member States to grant provisional authorisation for plant-protection products containing the active substance concerned while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of the Directive and, in particular, the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant-protection product in the light of the requirements laid down by the Directive.</p>
      <p n="17">(7) Such decision does not prejudice that further data or information may be requested from the applicant in order to clarify certain points in the dossier. The request by the rapporteur Member State for the submission of further data necessary to clarify the dossier shall not affect the time limit for the submission of the report referred to under recital 9.</p>
