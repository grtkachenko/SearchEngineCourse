      <p n="13">(2) Decision 94/611/EC has been replaced by Commission Decision 2000/147/EC(5), which does not refer to Classes A, thus necessitating an amendment to Decision 96/603/EC.</p>

      <p n="19">2. the Annex is amended as follows:</p>

      <p n="22">(b) the general notes are amended as follows:</p>
