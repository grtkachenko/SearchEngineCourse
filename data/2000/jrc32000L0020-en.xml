      <p n="12">(1) Directive 64/432/EEC(3) has been amended and updated by Directive 97/12/EC(4) and by Directive 98/46/EC(5).</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Problems concerning the implementation of Directive 64/432/EEC as amended by the two aforementioned Directives require transitional measures to avoid disturbances in trade in live animals of the bovine and porcine species.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Moreover, Directive 64/432/EEC and Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 of 21 April 1997 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products(6) refer to the creation of computer databases, inter alia for bovine animals, to store information on animals and their movements.</p>

      <p n="16">(5) Directive 64/432/EEC is to be amended to ensure consistency of Community rules and to allow the Commission to adopt transitional measures allowing the Member States to adapt to the new trade conditions.</p>
