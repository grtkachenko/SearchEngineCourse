      <p n="2">Directive 2000/61/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 10 October 2000</p>
      <p n="4">amending Council Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71(1)(c) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">After consulting the Committee of the Regions,</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) The standardisation work of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on quality control in the transport of dangerous goods has not yet been completed; the Commission cannot therefore make a report on the subject at present; it is therefore necessary to amend the deadline laid down in the fourth subparagraph of Article 1(2) of Directive 94/55/EC(4).</p>
      <p n="13">(2) The work of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) on the provisions concerning the centres of gravity of tank-vehicles laid down in Annex B to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) has not yet been completed; it is therefore necessary to amend the deadline laid down in Article 5(3)(b) of Directive 94/55/EC.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) A provision should be included to allow certain Member States, because of their climatic conditions, to apply stricter standards relating to certain equipment used in transport.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The standardisation work of the CEN on receptacles and tanks has not yet been completed; it is therefore necessary to amend the deadlines laid down in Article 6(4) of Directive 94/55/EC.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) It is necessary to ensure consistency between the provisions of Directive 94/55/EC and the amendments required to adapt the annexes thereto to scientific and technical progress.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) The deadlines laid down in Article 6(4) of Directive 94/55/EC regarding certain equipment should be put back; identifying the equipment concerned and the latest date for the application of Directive 94/55/EC should be made subject to the procedure laid down in Article 9 thereof.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) The derogation provided for in Article 6(9) of Directive 94/55/EC should be made subject to the procedure laid down in Article 9 thereof.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) Member States should be allowed to adopt derogations with regard to local transport operations and authorisation for that purpose should be made subject to the procedure laid down in Article 9 of Directive 94/55/EC.</p>
      <p n="20">(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).</p>
      <p n="21">(10) The conditions to be fulfilled before a transport operation may be regarded as an ad hoc transport operation should be specified.</p>
      <p n="22">(11) Directive 94/55/EC should be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="23">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>

      <p n="29">The provisions in question shall cease to apply if similar measures are made obligatory under Community provisions.</p>
      <p n="30">At the latest two years after the entry into force of a European standard on quality control in the transport of dangerous goods, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report assessing the safety aspects covered by this point together with an appropriate proposal for its continuation or repeal";</p>
      <p n="31">2. Article 5 shall be amended as follows:</p>
