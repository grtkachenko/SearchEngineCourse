      <p n="8">Whereas the agricultural agreement concluded in the framework Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC (5) abolished import levies and provided only for Common Customs Tariff duties; whereas Regulation (EC) No 1431/94 should therefore be adapted accordingly;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, with a view to preventing speculation and in the light of experience acquired especially concerning the high number of applicants, the conditions for gaining access to the system must be adjusted in order to exclude the operators who do not have the intention to use the certificates to fulfil their own needs;</p>

      <p n="18">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
