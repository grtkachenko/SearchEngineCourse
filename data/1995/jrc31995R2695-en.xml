      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2588/95 (2), and in particular Article 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 950/68 of 28 June 1968 on the Common Customs Tariff (3), repealed by Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, established the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff on the basis of the Convention of 15 December 1950 on nomenclature for the classification of goods in customs tariffs;</p>

      <p n="10">Whereas those Regulations which are still of practical significance and whose transposition will involve no changes of substance should be amended accordingly and so to complement an initial series of Regulations which has been adopted by Commission Regulations (EEC) No 646/89 (5), (EEC) No 2723/90 (6), and (EEC) No 2080/91 (7),</p>
