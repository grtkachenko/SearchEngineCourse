      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2810/95 of 5 December 1995 on the tariff classification of pig carcases and half- carcases and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2810/95 of 5 December 1995 on the tariff classification of pig carcases and half-carcases and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 (2), and in particular Article 11 (4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas it has been noted that the classification of pig carcases and half-carcases poses problems arising from the fact that the manner in which the half-carcases are derived from the whole carcase as defined in the tariff and statistical nomenclature established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2588/95 (4), does not correspond exactly to technical and commercial practices; whereas this definition must be adjusted in order to ensure that the duties in the Common Customs Tariff are uniformly applied in the pigmeat sector;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 states that the rates of duty of the Common Customs Tariff are to apply to the products subject to the common organization of the market in pigmeat;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, pursuant to Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75, the tariff nomenclature resulting from the application of that Regulation is incorporated in the Common Customs Tariff; whereas it should therefore be amended;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">For the purpose of applying the customs duties in the pigmeat sector, the following expressions shall have the meanings hereunder assigned to them:</p>
      <p n="13">'carcases or half-carcases`, for the purposes of subheadings 0203 11 10 and 0203 21 10: slaughtered pigs in the form of carcases of domestic swine which have been bled and eviscerated and from which the bristles and hooves have been removed. Half-carcases are derived from whole carcases by division through each cervical dorsal, lumbar and sacral vertebra, through or along the sternum and through the ischio-pubic symphysis. These carcases and half-carcases may be with or without head, feet, flare fat, kidneys, tail or diaphragm. Half-carcases may be with or without spinal cord, brain or tongue. Carcases and half-carcases of sows may be with or without udders (mammary glands).</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">Additional note 2.A.(a) in Chapter 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="16">'2.A. The following expressions shall have the meanings hereunder assigned to them:</p>
      <p n="17">(a) "carcases or half-carcases", for the purposes of subheadings 0203 11 10 and 0203 21 10; slaughtered pigs in the form of carcases of domestic swine which have been bled and eviscerated and from which the bristles and hooves have been removed. Half-carcases are derived from whole carcases by division through each cervical dorsal, lumbar and sacral vertebra, through or along the sternum and through the ischio-pubic symphysis. These carcases and half-carcases may be with or without head, feet, flare fat, kidneys, tail or diaphragm. Half-carcases may be with or without spinal cord, brain or tongue. Carcases and half-carcases of sows may be with or without udders (mammary glands);`.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 3</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1996.</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Done at Brussels, 5 December 1995.</p>
      <p n="22">For the Commission Franz FISCHLER Member of the Commission</p>
