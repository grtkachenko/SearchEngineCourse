      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EC) No 1935/95 of 22 June 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1935/95 of 22 June 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the Commission has received a specific mandate in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (4) to review a number of provisions of that Regulation by 1 July 1994 to submit any appropriate proposal for revision of that Regulation;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas it has become apparent that the provisions, expiring on 1 July 1995 concerning the labelling of agricultural products and foodstuffs containing an ingredient of agricultural origin which was produced by producers converting to organic farming, should be extended in order to permit those producers to valorize the additional cost of their production by an appropriate labelling of their products;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the review of Articles 5, 10 and 11 requested by the Council by 1 July 1994 has shown that a number of technical and drafting amendments in those Articles as well as in certain other provisions are necessary to ensure a proper management and implementation of the Regulation; whereas priority has therefore been given to the establishment of these amended rules and that consequently the establishment of the rules concerning animal production should be postponed for a limited period;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas it has become apparent from the review that the provisions concerning the labelling of foodstuffs prepared only partly from ingredients of agricultural origin which were produced according to organic production methods, should be improved in order to permit greater emphasis to be placed on the organically produced component in such foodstuffs;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas it has also become apparent that the indication provided for in Annex V should remain optional, but should also, in order to prevent improper use of that indication, be restricted to sales of prepackaged foodstuffs or direct sales by the producer or preparer to the ultimate consumer, provided that the nature of the product can be identified unambiguously;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it has furthermore become apparent that propagating material should be obtained from organically grown plants but that a system of derogations is necessary in order to enable producers to use, during a transitional period, conventionally-produced propagating material, where no appropriate organically-produced propagating material is available;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, for the same reasons, it must be permissible for whole seedlings obtained in a conventional manner and intended for planting for plant production to be used for an interim period;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas it has become apparent that a number of products which were used before the adoption of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 in accordance with the codes of practice of organic farming followed in the Community, have not been included in Annex II of the Regulation; whereas the use of such products should be permitted to the extent that their use is also permitted in conventional agriculture;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas it has appeared appropriate to clarify that the inspection system provided for applies also to importers of products from third countries established in the European Union;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended,</p>
      <p n="18">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="19">Article 1</p>
