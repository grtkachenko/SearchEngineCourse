      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EC) No 603/95 of 21 February 1995 on the common organization of the market in dried fodder</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 603/95 of 21 February 1995 on the common organization of the market in dried fodder</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 42 and 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1117/78 (3) set up a common organization of the market in dried fodder; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1417/78 (4) set out the aid system for dried fodder;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas a simple flat rate aid payment should be made for dried fodder; whereas the rate for fodder which is artificially heat-dried should be higher than that for sun-dried fodder in order to take into account the additional costs involved;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas in order to limit Community dried fodder production, the amount for which aid may be granted should be subject to maximum limits;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas two different maximum guaranteed quantities (MGQ) should be fixed, one for artificially heat-dried fodder and another for sun-dried;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas these MGQs should be distributed between Member States on an equitable basis taking into account, in particular, the average of their production for which aid was received under Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1117/78 in the marketing years 1992/93 and 1993/94 according to the data available to the Commission in July 1994;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas in order to ensure that the MGQs are respected and in order to discourage excess production throughout the Community, in the event of an overshoot, the aid for dried fodder should be reduced; whereas that reduction should equally be applied in all Member States for the first 5 % by which the MGQ is exceeded; whereas in the event of a larger excess, those Member States which have exceeded their national guaranteed quantities should be subject to an additional reduction;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the final amount of the aid cannot be paid until it has been calculated whether the MGQ has been exceeded; whereas it is therefore necessary that advance payments of the aid be made after the dried fodder has left the processing undertaking;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the European Parliament has called for a more substantial advance than the 50 % provided for in the Commission proposal; whereas the Commission has endorsed that view; whereas, as a consequence, the amounts appearing in Article 6 have become provisional; whereas, in order to meet this request, the Council will forthwith examine the question of the amount of the advances on the basis of the Commission proposal, so that a regulation settling the issue definitively can be adopted as soon as possible;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the marketing year for dried fodder for which aid is paid should be from 1 April each year to 31 March of the following year as production in southern Member States commences already in April;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas criteria relative to the minimum quality of dried fodder entitled to aid should be determined;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas, in order to encourage a regular supply of green fodder to processors and to enable producers to benefit from the aid scheme, the granting of aid should in certain cases be conditional on the conclusion of contracts between producers and processing undertakings;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas the contracts should, on the one hand, promote regular supplies for the processing undertakings and, on the other, permit the producers to benefit from the aid; whereas, to this end, it should be laid down that the contracts include certain information;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas processing undertakings should fulfil certain conditions necessary for entitlement to aid; whereas these undertakings should therefore keep stock accounts, including the details necessary for verification of entitlement to aid and should furnish any other necessary proof;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas, where there are no contracts between the producers and the processing undertakings, other information should be furnished by the latter for the purpose of verification of entitlement to aid;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas, in the case of special-order contracts concerning the processing of fodder delivered by the producer, provision should be made to enable the aid to be passed back to the producer;</p>
      <p n="22">Whereas, in order to facilitate implementation of the measures envisaged, a procedure should be provided for which establishes close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within a Management Committee;</p>
      <p n="23">Whereas, under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the Community has negotiated various agreements (hereinafter referred to as the 'GATT agreements`); whereas several of those agreements concern agriculture, in particular the Agreement on Agriculture (hereinafter referred to as 'the Agreement`);</p>
      <p n="24">Whereas, since the Agreement on Safeguards lays down clear rules on the application of protective clauses as incorporated in the market organizations, the safeguard clause applicable to dried fodder should be supplemented by a reference to the obligations flowing from international agreements;</p>
      <p n="25">Whereas it is necessary to ensure that the entry into force of the new rules on trade with third countries coincides with the date on which the obligations for the Community resulting from the Multilateral Trade Negotiations of the Uruguay Round take effect;</p>
      <p n="26">Whereas Regulations (EEC) No 1117/78 and (EEC) No 1417/78 should be repealed, with the exception for the former of certain articles which shall remain in force until the date of application of the legislation enforcing the results of the negotiations of the Uruguay Round,</p>

      <p n="28">Article 1</p>
      <p n="29">There shall be a common organization of the market in dried fodder covering the following products:</p>
      <p n="30">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="31">Article 2</p>
      <p n="32">The marketing year for the products referred to in Article 1 shall begin on 1 April of each year and end on 31 March of the following year.</p>

      <p n="34">Aid System</p>
      <p n="35">Article 3</p>
      <p n="36">1. Aid shall be granted for the products listed in Article 1.</p>
      <p n="37">2. Without prejudice to Article 5 the aid for the products listed in the first and third indents of Article 1 (a) and in Article 1 (b) shall be 68,83 ECU/tonne.</p>
      <p n="38">3. Without prejudice to Article 5 the aid for the products listed in the second and fourth indents of Article 1 (a) shall be 38,64 ECU/tonne.</p>

      <p n="41">2. The MGQ referred to in paragraph 1 shall be divided as follows between the Member States:</p>
      <p n="42">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="43">3. A maximum guaranteed quantity (MGQ) per marketing year of 443 500 tonnes of sun-dried fodder for which the aid referred to in Article 3 (3) may be granted is hereby established.</p>

      <p n="45">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="46">Article 5</p>
      <p n="47">Where the amount of dried fodder for which aid is claimed under Article 3 (2) or 3 (3) in any marketing year exceeds the MGQ referred to in Article 4 (1) or 4 (3) respectively, the aid to be paid in that year shall be calculated as follows:</p>
      <p n="48">- for the first 5 % by which the MGQ is exceeded, the aid shall be reduced in all Member States by an amount which is proportionate to that excess,</p>
      <p n="49">- for any excess beyond 5 % additional reductions shall be made in any Member State in which production exceeds the NGQ increased by 5 % proportionate to this excess.</p>
      <p n="50">The reduction to be applied shall be set by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17 and shall be such as to ensure that expenditure expressed in agricultural ecu does not exceed that what would have been attained if the relevant MGQ had not been exceeded.</p>
      <p n="51">Article 6</p>
      <p n="52">1. Undertakings processing dried fodder which apply for aid under this Regulation shall be entitled to an advance payment:</p>

      <p n="56">2. In order to qualify for an advance payment, the dried fodder in question must have left the processing undertaking.</p>
      <p n="57">3. Where an advance has been made, a balance shall be paid equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of the advance and the total amount of aid due to the undertaking processing dried fodder, taking into account the provisions of Article 5.</p>
      <p n="58">Article 7</p>
      <p n="59">Member States shall communicate to the Commission, at the latest by 31 May of each year the quantities of dried fodder eligible for aid under Article 3 (2) and Article 3 (3) in the preceding marketing year.</p>
