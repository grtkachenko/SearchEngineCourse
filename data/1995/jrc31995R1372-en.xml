      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1372/95 of 16 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the poultrymeat sector</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1372/95 of 16 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the poultrymeat sector</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden and by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 (2), and in particular Articles 3 (2), 8 (12) and 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 of 22 December 1994 on the adjustments and transitional arrangements required in the agricultural sector in order to implement the agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, and in particular Article 3 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 provides that from 1 July 1995 all exports for which export refunds are requested, with the exception of exports of day-old chicks, shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund; whereas therefore specific implementing rules should be laid down for the poultrymeat sector which should, in particular, include provisions for the submission of the applications and the information which must appear on the applications and licences, in addition to those contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing licences for agricultural products (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1199/95 (4);</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, in order to assure proper administration of the system, the rate of the security for export licences under the said system should be fixed; whereas in view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the poultrymeat sector, export licences should not be transferable and precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down; whereas it is necessary for particular conditions of access in the case of export licences for certain traditional markets in order to limit speculative applications which could put at risk the production which is specifically destined for those markets for a transitional period;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Article 8 (11) of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 provides that compliance with the obligations arising from agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations regarding the export volume shall be ensured on the basis of the export licences; whereas therefore a detailed schedule for the lodging of applications and for the issuing of licences should be laid down;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, in addition, the decision regarding applications for export licences should be communicated only after a period of consideration; whereas this period would allow the Commission to appreciate the quantities applied for as well as the expenditure involved and, if appropriate, to take specific measures applicable in particular to the applications which are pending; whereas it is in the interest of traders to allow the licence application to be withdrawn after the acceptance coefficient has been fixed;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, in the case of applications concerning quantities equal to or less than 25 tonnes, the export licence should be issued immediately if the trader requests it; whereas these licences, however, should benefit from refunds only in accordance with the measures which the Commission might possibly have taken for the period in question;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas in order to ensure an exact follow up of the quantities to be exported, a derogation from the rules regarding the tolerances laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 should be laid down;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the Commission must dispose of precise information concerning applications for licences and of the use of licences issued, in order to be able to manage this system; whereas, in the interests of efficient administration, the notifications from Member States to the Commission should be made according to a uniform model;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas to avoid any interruption of exports at the time of entry into force of the Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round, authorization should be given for export licences to be applied for and issued before the date of the entry into force of this Agreement, but for use after that date;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas Article 8 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 provides that for day-old chicks export refunds may be granted on the basis of an 'ex-post` export licence; whereas therefore implementing rules for such a system should be laid down with the aim of ensuring efficient verification that the obligations arising from the agreements concluded in the framework of the Uruguay Round negotiations are complied with; whereas, however, it would appear unnecessary to require the lodging of a security in the case of licences applied for after exportation;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 572/73 of 26 February 1973 establishing egg and poultrymeat products eligible for the advance fixing of export refunds (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3501/93 (2), and of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3652/81 of 18 December 1981 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of advance fixing certificates for refunds in the poultrymeat and eggs sector (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1030/95 (4), are replaced by the provisions of this Regulation and of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1371/95 (5) laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the egg sector; whereas the abovementioned Regulations should therefore be repealed as from the date of entry into force of the Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by the chairman,</p>
      <p n="18">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="19">Article 1</p>
      <p n="20">As from 1 July 1995, all exports of products in the poultrymeat sector for which an export refund is requested, with the exception of chicks falling within CN codes 0105 11 and 0105 19, shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 to 8.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>
      <p n="22">1. Export licences shall be valid from the date of issue, within the meaning of Article 21 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88, until the end of the second month following that date.</p>
      <p n="23">2. Applications for licences and licences shall bear, in section 15, the description of the product and, in section 16, the 11-digit product code of the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds.</p>
      <p n="24">3. The categories of products referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 13a of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88, as well as the rate of the security for export licences, are set out in Annex I.</p>

Applicants for export licences must be natural or legal persons who, at the time applications are submitted, are able to prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities in the Member States that they have been engaged in trade in the poultrymeat sector for at least 12 months. However, retail establishments or restaurants selling their products to end consumers may not lodge applications.</p>
      <p n="40">As regards exports to countries referred to in Annex IV, until 30 June 1996 export licences may be applied for only by natural or legal persons who are able to prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities in the Member States that they have exported not less than 1 000 tonnes of products falling within CN codes 0207, 1602 20, 1602 31 and 1602 39 in each of the two calendar years preceding the year in which the licence application was lodged.</p>

      <p n="43">- set a single percentage by which the quantities applied for are accepted,</p>
      <p n="44">- refuse the applications for which export licences have not yet been awarded,</p>
      <p n="45">- suspend the lodging of applications for export licences for a maximum of five working days. A suspension for a longer period may be decided in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75. In these cases, applications for export licences lodged during the suspension period shall be inadmissible.</p>
      <p n="46">These measures may be adjusted according to the category of product.</p>
      <p n="47">5. Where quantities applied for are rejected or reduced, the security shall be released immediately for all quantities for which an application was not satisfied.</p>
      <p n="48">6. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, where a single percentage of acceptance less than 80 per cent is set, the licence shall be issued at the latest by the 11th working day following publication of that percentage in the Official Journal of the European Communities. During the 10 working days following its publication, the operator may:</p>
      <p n="49">- either withdraw his application, in which case the security is released immediately,</p>
      <p n="50">- or request immediate issuing of the licence, in which case the competent authority shall issue it without delay but no sooner than the Monday following the lodging of the licence application.</p>
