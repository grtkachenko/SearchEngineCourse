      <p n="5">Having regard to the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden and by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 (2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2273/93 of 28 July 1993 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3129/94 (4), has had to be adapted to bring it into line with the provisions of the Act of Accession;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the number of intervention centres determined for Sweden has proved insufficient to ensure that the intervention arrangements function properly in that country; whereas the number of intervention centres should accordingly be increased; whereas the additional intervention centres in Sweden have been determined on the basis of their geographical location and their storage facilities, which must permit the stockpiling and disposal of substantial quantities of cereals;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, if intervention is to function effectively in Sweden as from the 1994/95 marketing year, the changes introduced pursuant to this Regulation should come into effect as quickly as possible; whereas this Regulation should accordingly apply as soon as is feasible;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,</p>
