      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2526/95 of 27 October 1995 amending Regulation (EC) No 1439/95 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 as regards the import and export of products in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2526/95 of 27 October 1995 amending Regulation (EC) No 1439/95 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 as regards the import and export of products in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1265/95 (2), and in particular Articles 9 (2) and 12 (4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1439/95 of 26 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 as regards the import and export of products in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2416/95 (4), requires the submission of a licence upon export of products of the sheep and goatmeat sector; whereas experience in the operation of the export licence system has demonstrated that the deliverance of this licence creates a disproportionate administrative burden in particular in view of the small quantities that are exported from the Community; whereas it is therefore appropriate to delete this requirement;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Regulation (EC) No 1439/95 also fixes the list of authorities in exporting countries empowered to issue documents of origin; whereas Poland has changed the authority empowered to issue these documents with effect from 15 November 1995; whereas Annex I to the Regulation should therefore be modified accordingly;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheepmeat and Goatmeat,</p>
      <p n="9">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="10">Article 1</p>
      <p n="11">Regulation (EC) No 1439/95 is modified as follows:</p>
      <p n="12">1. Article 3 is deleted.</p>
      <p n="13">2. Article 19 (4) is deleted.</p>
      <p n="14">3. In Annex I, point 11 is replaced by:</p>
      <p n="15">'Poland; Polski Zwiazek Owezarski`.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 2</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="18">It shall apply from 15 November 1995.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="20">Done at Brussels, 27 October 1995.</p>
