      <p n="9">Whereas the forecast supply balance of cereal products to the Azores and Madeira, established by Regulation (EEC) No 1727/92, allows the quantities laid down for certain products to be interchanged; whereas, in order to meet requirements in the Azores, it has proved necessary to make changes to that forecast supply balance; whereas, in response to a request from the Portuguese authorities and for the sake of simplification, the time-limits for the submission of applications for licences and certificates should also be brought into line;</p>
