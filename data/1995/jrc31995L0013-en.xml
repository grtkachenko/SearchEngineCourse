      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 95/13/EC</p>
      <p n="3">of 23 May 1995</p>
      <p n="4">implementing Council Directive 92/75/EEC with regard to energy labelling of household electric tumble driers</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Directive 92/75/EEC of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources of household appliances (1), and in particular Articles 9 and 12 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas under Directive 92/75/EEC the Commission is to adopt an implementing directive in respect of household appliances including electric tumble driers;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas electricity use by tumble driers accounts for a significant part of total Community energy demand; whereas the scope for reduced energy use by these appliances is substantial;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the Community, confirming the interest of an international standardization system capable of producing standards that are actually used by all partners in international trade and of meeting the requirements of Community policy, invites the European standards organization to continue their cooperation with international standards organizations;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (Cenelec) are the bodies recognized as competent to adopt harmonized standards in accordance with the general guidelines for cooperation between the Commission and these two bodies signed on 13 November 1984; whereas, within the meaning of this Directive, a harmonized standard is a technical specification (European standard or harmonization document) adopted by Cenelec, on the basis of a remit (mandate) from the Commission in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 83/189/EEC of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (2), as last amended by Directive 94/10/EC of the European Parliament and the Council (3), and on the basis of those general guidelines;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the measures set out in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the committee set up under Article 10 of Directive 92/75/EEC,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>

      <p n="16">2. The information required by this Directive shall be measured in accordance with harmonized standards, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and for which Member States have published the reference numbers of the national standards transposing those harmonized standards. Throughout this Directive any provisions requiring the giving of information relating to noise shall apply only where that information is required under Article 3 of Council Directive 86/594/EEC (4). This information, where required, shall be measured in accordance with that Directive.</p>
      <p n="17">3. The harmonized standards referred to in paragraph 2 shall be drawn up under mandate from the Commission in accordance with Directive 83/189/EEC.</p>
      <p n="18">4. 'Dealer', 'supplier', 'information sheet', 'other essential resources' and 'supplementary information' shall have the meanings set out in Article 1 (4) of Directive 92/75/EEC.</p>

      <p n="28">4. In the circumstances covered by Article 5 of Directive 92/75/EEC, and where the offer for sale, hire, or hire purchase, is provided by means of a printed communication, such as a mail order catalogue, then that printed communication shall include all the information specified in Annex III to this Directive.</p>
      <p n="29">5. The energy efficiency class of an appliance, as specified in the label and the fiche, shall be as specified in Annex IV.</p>
      <p n="30">Article 3</p>

      <p n="34">However, Member States shall allow, until 30 September 1996:</p>
      <p n="35">- the placing on the market, the commercialization and/or the display of products,</p>
      <p n="36">- the distribution of the printed communications referred to in Article 2 (4), which do not conform to this Directive.</p>
      <p n="37">When Member States adopt these provisions, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The procedure for such reference shall be adopted by Member States.</p>
      <p n="38">2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="39">Article 5</p>
