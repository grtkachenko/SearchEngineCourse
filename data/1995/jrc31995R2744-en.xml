      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EC) No 2744/95 of 27 November 1995 on statistics on the structure and distribution of earnings</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2744/95 of 27 November 1995 on statistics on the structure and distribution of earnings</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 213 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, in order to carry out the tasks assigned to it, the Commission must be kept informed of the position and trend of earnings in the Member States of the Community with regard, on the one hand, to their variations in terms of the structure of the labour force and, on the other hand, to the distribution of employees according to earnings level;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the development of the Community and the operation of the internal market increase the need for comparable data on the structure of earnings, particularly as a means of analysing the progress of economic and social cohesion and for establishing reliable comparisons between the Member States and the regions of the Community;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the best method of assessing the situation as regards the structure and distribution of earnings is to produce Community statistics of the structure of earnings using harmonized methods and definitions, as was done in 1966, 1972, 1974 and 1978 pursuant to Regulations No 188/64/EEC (1), (EEC) No 2395/71 (2), (EEC) No 178/74 (3), and (EEC) No 495/78 (4) respectively;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, owing to the changes which occur in the structure of the labour force and in the distribution of earnings, particularly as regards economic activities, the results of the earlier surveys are no longer up to date and do not cover all the Member States;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the data currently available for the Member States as a whole supply only averages and are not therefore likely to provide any indication either of the relationship between earnings and the individual characteristics of wage earners (particularly age, sex, professional status, length of service) or of the spread of earnings;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas statistical information in this field is available only in certain Member States and valid comparisons cannot therefore be made; whereas the statistics of the structure of earnings must consequently be carried out on the basis of common definitions and harmonized methodologies;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the creation of common statistical standards enabling harmonized information to be produced is action which can be effectively undertaken only at Community level; whereas these standards will be implemented in each Member State on the authority of the agencies and institutions appointed to compile official statistics;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, pursuant to Decision 93/464/EEC (5), the production of Community statistics on the structure of earnings is one of the priority actions in the Statistical Programme 1993 to 1997;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas it seems appropriate to make provisions for exceptions for certain Member States, in order to take account of particular technical difficulties encountered by such States in the collection of certain types of information, provided that the quality of the statistical information is not affected;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the Statistical Programme Committee established by Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (6), has reached a favourable conclusion on the Commission proposal,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">General provisions</p>
      <p n="19">The Member States and the Commission, within their respective fields of competences, shall produce Community statistics on the structure and distribution of all employees' earnings in the sections of economic activities defined in Article 3.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">Reference period</p>
      <p n="22">The statistics shall be produced on the basis of statistical information for the financial year of 1995 and for a corresponding representative month, subject to the special provisions mentioned in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
      <p n="24">Scope</p>
      <p n="25">The statistics shall cover all activities defined in sections C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and K of the Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, hereinafter referred to as 'NACE Rev. 1` established by Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 (1), subject to the special provisions mentioned in the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 4</p>
      <p n="27">Statistical Units</p>
      <p n="28">Collection of data and compilation of statistics on the structure and distribution of earnings shall be based on any of the statistical units defined in Regulation (EEC) No 696/93 (2) and shall provide information for employees in local units of 10 and more employees classified by size and principal activity.</p>
      <p n="29">Article 5</p>
      <p n="30">Characteristics of the required information</p>
      <p n="31">Data shall be collected on:</p>

      <p n="36">(b) annual gross earnings in the relevant financial year, i.e. the gross earnings as defined in 2 (a) referred to an annual basis, plus occasional bonuses (such as holiday bonuses, 13th month and profit sharing); the amount of occasional bonuses must be specified separately;</p>
      <p n="37">(c) the number of hours paid or the number of hours in a standard working week or month for which payment is made, the number of paid overtime hours in the pay period and the number of holidays, excluding public holidays per year;</p>

      <p n="43">3. Persons required to supply information shall reply to the questions truthfully, completely and within the time limits set. The Member States shall take appropriate measures to avoid any infringement of the obligation to supply the information referred to in Article 5.</p>
      <p n="44">4. The survey need not be carried out if the Member States have information from other appropriate sources which is at least equivalent as regards accuracy, quality and timeliness.</p>
      <p n="45">5. The Member States shall forward to the Commission (Eurostat) at its request all information, particularly concerning methodologies, needed for the application of this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="46">Article 7</p>
      <p n="47">Representativeness</p>
      <p n="48">The reliability and comparability on a high quality level shall be attained by the use of sampling sizes allowing that the relative standard error for the variable average gross hourly earnings by section or subsection, where it exists, of NACE Rev. 1 at NUTS 1 level does not exceed 3 %.</p>
      <p n="49">Article 8</p>
      <p n="50">Processing of results</p>
