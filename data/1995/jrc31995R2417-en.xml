      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 150/95 (2), and in particular Article 13 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 424/95 (4), and in particular Article 7 (3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas with effect from 1 February 1995, Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 alters the value in ecus of certain prices and amounts in order to neutralize the effects of the abolition of the corrective factor of 1,207509 which until 31 January 1995 affected the conversion rates used for agriculture;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the new values in ecu of the prices and amounts concerned have been established as of 1 February 1995 according to the rules laid down in Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 and Article 18 (1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 of 30 April 1993 on detailed rules for determining and applying the agricultural conversion rates (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1053/95 (6);</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in accordance with Article 18 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93, in order to avoid confusion and facilitate the application of the common agricultural policy, it is necessary to replace the value in ecus of the prices and amounts concerned where they are not of periodic application, and where they are applicable at least from:</p>
      <p n="10">- 1 January 1996 in respect of the amounts not concerned by a marketing year,</p>
      <p n="11">- the beginning of the 1996 marketing year in the case of the prices or amounts for which that marketing year starts in January 1996,</p>
      <p n="12">- the beginning of the 1995/96 marketing year in the other cases,</p>
      <p n="13">which appear in regulations that came into force before 1 February 1995; whereas the Regulations concerned should therefore be amended;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas in the interests of clarity the new values in ecu in respect of securities required under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2182/77 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1759/93 (8), Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79 (9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1759/93, Regulation (EEC) No 985/81 (10), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1759/93, Regulation (EEC) No 2539/84 (11), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1759/93, Regulation (EEC) No 2456/93 (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1999/95 (13), should be rounded to the nearest whole number;</p>
