      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 785/95 of 6 April 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 603/95 on the common organization of the market in dried fodder</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 603/95 of 21 February 1995 on the common organization of the market in dried fodder (1), and in particular Article 18 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, in order to ensure efficient application of the system of aid for dried fodder, certain concepts should be defined;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, in order to avoid any risk of double payment, it is appropriate to exclude all of the products benefitting from the aid of arable crops listed in Annex I of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 (2), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, with the exception of sweet lupins until the flowering stage, from the scope of the aid for dried fodder;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, having regard to the criteria laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 603/95, the minimum quality for the products in question, expressed in terms of moisture and protein content, should be laid down; whereas, taking account of commercial practices, the moisture content should be differentiated according to certain production processes;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 603/95 lays down that Member States must carry out checks to verify that all undertakings and buyers of fodder for drying satisfy the conditions set out in that Regulation; whereas, in order to facilitate such checks and to ensure fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility for aid, processing undertakings and buyers of fodder for drying should be subject to an approval procedure; whereas, to the same end, the details to be included in aid applications, stock records and delivery declarations of processing undertakings should be specified; whereas the other supporting documents to be supplied should be specified;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, in order to ensure uniform application of the system of aid, the payment procedures should be defined;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, in order to facilitate the marketing of fodder for processing and to enable the competent authorities to carry out the checks necessary for verifying entitlement to aid, contracts between processing undertakings and farmers should be concluded before delivery of the raw materials and lodged with the competent authorities before a certain date to enable them to know the expected volume of production; whereas, to that end, contracts must be in writing, indicate the date of conclusion, the period of validity, the names and addresses of the contracting parties and the nature of the products to be processed and identify the agricultural parcel on which the fodder to be processed was grown;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, where there are no such contracts, delivery declarations, subject to the conditions applicable to contracts, must be drawn up by the processing undertaking;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, in order to verify that the quantities of raw materials delivered to undertakings tally with the quantities of dried fodder leaving them, the said undertakings should weigh all fodder for processing and determine its moisture content;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, in order to permit effective verification of the right to aid, in view of the different levels of aid provided for artificially dried fodder and sun-dried fodder, it is essential that processing undertakings manufacture and stock the different products in separate premises;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas rigorous checks must be carried out to ensure fulfilment of the quality requirements for dried fodder based on regular sampling of finished products leaving undertakings; whereas, where those products are mixed with other materials, samples must be taken before mixing;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas Regulation (EC) No 603/95 provides for a series of checks to be carried out at each stage of the production process, inter alia linked to the integrated verification and management system; whereas, therefore, checks on the identification of the agricultural parcels concerned should be coordinated with the checks carried out under that system;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas, in order to ensure efficient management of the market for dried fodder, the Commission must receive certain information on a regular basis;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas, in order to ensure fulfilment of the conditions laid down in the relevant rules, in particular regarding eligibility for aid, penalties should be laid down to prevent any infringements;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1528/78 (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1069/93 (2), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2743/78 (3) are replaced by this Regulation; whereas they should therefore be repealed;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas Regulation (EC) No 603/95 applies as from 1 April 1995, the date on which the marketing year 1995/96 begins; whereas this Regulation should therefore apply as from the same date;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas the Joint Management Committee for Cereals, Oils and Fats and Dried Fodder has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,</p>
      <p n="22">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="23">Article 1</p>
      <p n="24">This Regulation lays down the detailed rules for the application of the common organization of the market in dried fodder set up by Regulation (EC) No 603/95.</p>

      <p n="40">4. 'lot` means a specific quantity of fodder of uniform quality as regards composition, moisture content and protein content, leaving a processing undertaking at the same time.</p>
      <p n="41">Article 3</p>
      <p n="42">1. For the purposes of this Regulation, in order to obtain entitlement to the aid referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 603/95, the products referred to in Article 2 (1) shall be considered to have left the processing undertaking where:</p>
      <p n="43">(a) they leave in the unaltered state:</p>
      <p n="44">- the precincts of the processing undertaking,</p>
      <p n="45">- where the dried fodder cannot be stored in those precincts, any storage place outside them offering adequate safeguards for the purposes of checking the fodder stored and which has been approved in advance by the competent authority,</p>
      <p n="46">- in the case of mobile drying equipment, the equipment in which the dehydration is carried out and, if the dehydrated fodder is stored by the person having dried it, any storage place which satisfies the conditions of the second indent; or (b) they leave the precincts or any storage place referred to at (a) having been mixed within the processing undertaking with raw materials, other than those specified in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 603/95 and those used for binding, with a view to the manufacture of compound feed, and, at the time they leave the processing undertaking, are of sound and fair merchantable quality meeting the requirements for being placed on the market as feedingstuffs and have the following characteristics:</p>

      <p n="54">However, during the 1995/96 marketing year, dried fodder leaving an undertaking may be admitted to another undertaking on the condition that that operation takes place under the supervision of, and under the conditions fixed by, the competent authority of the Member States concerned.</p>
      <p n="55">Article 4</p>
      <p n="56">1. For the purposes of approval referred to in Article 2 (2), the processing undertaking:</p>

      <p n="61">The processing undertaking shall have its approval withdrawn for a period to be specified by the competent authority, commensurate with the seriousness of the infringements found, if at least one of the conditions referred to at (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph is no longer met.</p>
      <p n="62">2. For the purposes of approval as referred to in Article 2 (3), a purchaser of fodder for drying and grinding must:</p>

      <p n="105">Except in cases of force majeure, late submission of the abovementioned documents shall result in a reduction of 1 % per working day of the total amount of aid to which the undertaking would be entitled if it had submitted them in time. Where the delay exceeds 20 days, undertakings shall lose their entitlement to the aid.</p>
      <p n="106">Article 9</p>
      <p n="107">Processing undertakings shall determine, for fodder to be dehydrated and, where applicable, for sun-dried fodder delivered to them for processing, the quantities delivered, measured by systematic weighing. However, this provision shall not apply where the fodder to be dehydrated is processed in a mobile dehydration unit. In such cases only, the delivered quantities may be estimated on the basis of the areas sown.</p>
      <p n="108">The average moisture content of the quantities of fodder to be dehydrated shall be measured by comparing the quantities used and the quantities of finished product obtained.</p>
      <p n="109">Article 10</p>
      <p n="110">Where a processing undertaking carries out the manufacture, on the one hand, of dehydrated fodder and/or protein concentrates and, on the other hand, of sun-dried fodder:</p>
