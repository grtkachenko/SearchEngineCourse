      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the markets in sugar sector (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1101/95 (2), and in particular Articles 13 (2) and 17 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas the Agreement on Agriculture resulting from the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations (hereinafter referred to as 'the Agreement`) calls for the adaptation, in particular, of regulations applicable to import and export licences in the sugar sector from 1 July 1995; whereas, in view of the number of adaptations required and for reasons of clarity and greater administrative efficiency, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2630/81 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1754/93 (4), should be repealed, whilst keeping those provisions of that Regulation which are still relevant for the application of the system of import and export licences; whereas, for the same persons, derogations should be made from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1199/95 (6);</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas as a result of the Agreement, the concept in trade of advance-fixing disappears at the importation stage but becomes the rule at the exportation stage as from 1 July 1995; whereas, therefore, distinctions in respect of the corresponding securities need no longer be maintained for licences;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, as a result of the most recent enlargement of the Community, some adaptations of a formal nature should also be made;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="124">The application for an import licence shall relate to a quantity of raw sugar of the standard quality which, having regard to its yield, corresponds to the quantity of white sugar shown on the application for an export licence. The yield of the raw sugar shall be calculated by deducting 100 from the amount obtained by multiplying by two the degree of polarization of the sugar.</p>
      <p n="125">Where the imported raw sugar does not correspond to the standard quality, the quantity of raw sugar to be imported under the licence shall be calculated by multiplying the quantity of raw sugar of the standard quality referred to in the licence by an corrective factor. The corrective factor shall be obtained by dividing 92 by the percentage yield of the raw sugar actually imported.</p>
      <p n="126">3. By way of derogation from Article 6, the export licence for white sugar and the import licence for raw sugar shall be valid:</p>
      <p n="127">- until 30 June where the application has been lodged, within the meaning of Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88, on or after 1 October of the marketing year in question,</p>

      <p n="130">However, the amount of the said security shall be adjusted as shown in the Annex hereto by reference to the amount of the export levy on raw sugar applicable on the day on which the application for the import licence is lodged and on each Monday during the period of validity of the licence.</p>
      <p n="131">The applicant for the import licence shall be required to make the appropriate increase in the security referred to in the second subparagraph either on the day on which his application is lodged or within three working days after the relevant Monday. On request by the holder of the import licence the competent authority shall release forthwith that part of the security no longer required as a result of any downward adjustment thereof.</p>
      <p n="132">Moreover, at the request of the applicant, which must be made at the same time as application for the import licence, and on production of the relevant documentary proof, the competent authority shall reduce the security required in pursuance of the second and third subparagraphs of this paragraph to the amount of the security lodged, pursuant to Article 115 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92, upon the prior exportation of the corresponding amount of white sugar.</p>
      <p n="133">The amount of the security as adjusted in pursuance of this paragraph may in no case, however, be less than the amount of the security specified in the first subparagraph.</p>

      <p n="136">(a) the whole of the security in respect of the import licence shall be released only where the quantity of raw sugar actually imported is equal to or greater than the quantity of white sugar actually exported, taking into account the yield of the raw sugar;</p>
      <p n="137">(b) where the quantity of raw sugar actually imported is less than the quantity of white sugar actually exported, then the security shall be forfeit in an amount corresponding to the difference between the amount of white sugar actually exported and the amount of raw sugar actually imported. This provision shall be applied having regard to the yield of the raw sugar involved;</p>
      <p n="138">(c) where the person concerned has not made the request referred to in the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 4, then that part of the security resulting from the application of the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 and which may be forfeit under point (b) of this paragraph shall be reduced by any amount forfeit under Article 115 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92.</p>
      <p n="139">This reduction shall be made only at the request of the party concerned and after production of appropriate supporting documents;</p>
      <p n="140">(d) where, when paragraph 4 applies, the holder of an import licence fails to increase the security within the prescribed period, then the said security, adjusted as necessary in accordance with that paragraph, shall, except in cases of force majeure, be forthwith forfeit in its entirety.</p>
      <p n="141">If, however, a request has not been made under the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 4, then the amount forfeit shall, on expiry of the import licence, be reduced as provided for in point (c) of this paragraph.</p>
      <p n="142">7. In application of Article 561 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92, the time limit within which the import of raw sugar corresponding to a previous export of white sugar must be carried out shall be the same as the period of validity of the import licence for the raw sugar.</p>
      <p n="143">8. By way of derogation from Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88, the rights deriving from the export and import licences referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be transferable.</p>
      <p n="144">9. A cancellation under Article 13(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 shall apply simultaneously to both the import licence and the export licence as referred to in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p n="145">Article 11</p>
      <p n="146">Regulation (EEC) No 2630/81 is repealed with effect from 1 October 1995.</p>
