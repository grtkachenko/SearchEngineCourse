      <p n="7">Whereas the above Agreement has been amended or supplemented by the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and by the bilateral Agreement in the form of exchanges of letters with Norway and approved by Decision 93/737/EC (4);</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, following the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, the abovementioned quotas have to be adjusted to take into account, inter alia, the existing trade arrangements for fishery products between Austria, Finland and Sweden, on the one hand, and Norway, on the other;</p>

      <p n="10">Whereas the tariff quotas in question should accordingly be opened from 1 January to 31 December each year; whereas it has not been possible to implement these concessions before 1 July this year and therefore, exceptionally for 1995, provision must be made for the quotas to be opened for the period from 1 July to 31 December, but for the full annual volume;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters for certain agricultural products was concluded between the European Community, on the one hand, and the Kingdom of Norway, on the other hand, and approved by Decision 95/582/EC (6); whereas in the abovementioned Agreement the Community has undertaken to open from 1 January 1995 annual Community tariff quotas at zero duty for certain agricultural products from Norway,</p>
