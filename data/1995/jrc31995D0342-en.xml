      <p n="11">Whereas the types of treatment to be prescribed for milk and milk-based products for human consumption from such third countries or parts of third countries should be established;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the types of treatment are to be listed on the model health certificates for imports of milk and milk-based products from third countries or parts of third countries where there is a risk of foot-and-mouth disease;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the types of treatment to be prescribed must have a scientific basis of the sort recommended by the Scientific Veterinary Committee and must take account of public and animal health protection requirements;</p>
