      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 685/95 of 27 March 1995 on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 of 20 December 1992 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture (4) provides that it is the Council's responsibility to establish Community measures laying down the conditions of access to areas and resources and of the pursuit of fishing activities;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Regulation (EC) No 1275/94 (5) provides, with regard to the adjustment and incorporation into Community measures of the arrangements regarding access to waters and resources laid down in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, that the Council is to adopt, before 1 January 1995, the measures to be taken in accordance with Article 3 thereof;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas it is necessary to safeguard existing balances and the acquis communautaire, particularly the principle of relative stability;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas it is necessary to ensure that there is no increase in the overall levels of existing fishing effort within the areas and stocks covered by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and to provide for a reduction in that fishing effort if changes in resources make it necessary to introduce a general reduction of fishing opportunities;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas it is necessary to take account of the complexity of fishing activities and the biological, geographical and geomorphological characteristics of the resources; whereas particular note should be taken of the need to preserve the balance of those resources in highly sensitive areas;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it is the responsibility of flag Member States to regulate on fishing effort; whereas, as a result, it is necessary to ensure the transparency and equity of the management and monitoring procedures;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the introduction of a system for the management of fishing effort calls for certain accompanying Community measures,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">In accordance with the provisions of the common fisheries policy this Regulation establishes, with effect from 1 January 1996, the criteria and procedures for the introduction of a system for the management of fishing effort in ICES divisions Vb, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X and CECAF areas 34.1.1, 34.1.2, and 34.2.0.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">1. The Member States shall establish lists of named fishing vessels flying their respective flags which are authorized to carry out their fishing activities in the fisheries defined in Annex I.</p>
      <p n="20">2. The Member States may include other vessels on their lists of named vessels at a later date, provided there were entitlements to fish at the time that the reference lists were established.</p>
      <p n="21">3. The Member States may at a later date replace the vessels entered on their lists of named vessels.</p>
      <p n="22">4. In the event of any amendment to those lists, the criteria and procedures referred to in Articles 3 and 5 shall continue to apply.</p>
      <p n="23">TITLE I</p>
      <p n="24">Measures concerning the catching of demersal species</p>
      <p n="25">Article 3</p>
      <p n="26">1. With regard to each fishery for the catching of demersal species as defined in Annex I, the Member States shall assess the fishing effort necessary, on the basis of Community criteria for assessing the fishing efforts defined in Annex II.</p>
      <p n="27">2. These fishing efforts shall take account of the following conditions:</p>
      <p n="28">(i) effort levels shall allow each Member State, for each fishery, to take up fully its fishing possibilities, i.e. species subject to TAC's, allocated or not, as well as species not subject to such limitations;</p>
      <p n="29">(ii) effort levels shall be established pursuant to Community rules; existing balances in exploitation by fishery and by zone shall not be disturbed;</p>
      <p n="30">(iii) effort levels shall, in no way, affect the relative stability of the different fisheries.</p>
      <p n="31">3. The Member States shall introduce arrangements to regulate the fishing effort where the potential fishing effort corresponding to free access for fishing vessels entered on the list of named vessels exceeds the assessed effort.</p>
      <p n="32">4. The Member States concerned shall assess the fishing effort in ICES areas VII a and VII f north of latitude 50 째30&amp;prime; north in the light of traditional fishing activities.</p>
      <p n="33">5. The Member States concerned shall assess the fishing effort in the area south of latitude 56 째30&amp;prime; north, east of longitude 12 째 west and north of latitude 50 째30&amp;prime; north on the basis of the level of existing activity for their respective vessels, except for those flying the flag of Spain. The number of vessels flying the flag of Spain in this area may not exceed 40, in full compliance with the provisions laid down in paragraph 2 (ii).</p>

      <p n="36">Article 4</p>
      <p n="37">1. With regard to the catching of pelagic species, including the highly migratory species, defined in Annex I, the Member States shall take steps to ensure a posteriori monitoring of the actual fishing effort.</p>
      <p n="38">2. In particular cases, the fishing effort may be regulated by the Council under the procedure laid down in Article 8 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92, taking account, inter alia, of existing balances in exploitation by fishery and by zone.</p>
      <p n="39">3. With a view to guaranteeing that the controls on fishing efforts, referred to in Article 3 (4) and (5), shall apply to fishing for pelagic species and other non-demersal species in ICES areas VII a and VII f, the Council will take a decision on a proposal from the Commission in accordance with the procedure provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article.</p>
