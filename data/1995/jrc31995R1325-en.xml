      <p n="6">Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules (1) introduced certain quantitative quotas, listed in Annexes III B, IV, V and VI to that Regulation, applicable to the countries listed in those Annexes;</p>

      <p n="11">Whereas on 19 January 1995 the Commission initialled an agreement on trade in textile products not covered by the bilateral MFA Agreement;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, therefore, from 1 January 1995, the quantitative quotas introduced by Regulation (EC) No 517/94 in Annexes III B, IV, V and VI thereto should be amended as shown in the Annex to this Regulation,</p>
