      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2196/95 of 18 September 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2191/81 on the granting of aid for the purchase of butter by non-profit-making institutions and organizations</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1538/95 (2), and in particular Article 12 (3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2191/81 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 455/95 (4), provides for the granting of aid for the purchase of butter by non-profit-making institutions and organizations; whereas New Zealand butter sold in the United Kingdom may benefit from a reduced rate of duty provided that it fulfils the conditions for categorization as first-class quality in that Member State; whereas the preferential import system for New Zealand butter is consolidated from 1 July 1995 under the Agriculture Agreement concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations; whereas Regulation (EC) No 1600/95 of 30 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements and opening tariff quotas for milk and milk products (5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1763/95 (6), fixes the rate of duty applicable to New Zealand butter imported within the tariff quota; whereas, therefore, Regulation (EEC) No 2191/81 should be amended;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,</p>
      <p n="8">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="9">Article 1</p>
      <p n="10">Article 2 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2191/81 is hereby replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="11">'3. The aid referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be granted in addition to the reduction in duty on New Zealand butter referred to in Annex I of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1600/95 (*). The amount of aid referred to in paragraph 1 shall therefore be reduced by the amount of the difference between the Common Customs Tariff duty for butter and the reduced duty.</p>
      <p n="12">`</p>
      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="16">Done at Brussels, 18 September 1995.</p>
      <p n="17">For the Commission Franz FISCHLER Member of the Commission</p>
