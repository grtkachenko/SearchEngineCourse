      <p n="119">PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE USE OF WORK EQUIPMENT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 4 (3)</p>
      <p n="120">0. General comment</p>
      <p n="121">The obligations laid down in this Annex apply having regard to the provisions of this Directive and where the corresponding risk exists for the work equipment in question.</p>
      <p n="122">1. General provisions for all work equipment</p>
      <p n="123">1.1. Work equipment must be installed, located and used in such a way as to reduce risks to users of the work equipment and for other workers, for example by ensuring that there is sufficient space between the moving parts of work equipment and fixed or moving parts in its environment and that all forms of energy and substances used or produced can be supplied and/or removed in a safe manner.</p>
      <p n="124">1.2. Work equipment must be erected or dismantled under safe conditions, in particular observing any instructions which may have been furnished by the manufacturer.</p>
      <p n="125">1.3. Work equipment which may be struck by lightning while being used must be protected by devices or appropriate means against the effects of lightning.</p>
      <p n="126">2. Provisions concerning the use of mobile equipment, whether or not self-propelled</p>
      <p n="127">2.1. Self-propelled work equipment shall be driven only by workers who have been appropriately trained in the safe driving of such equipment.</p>
      <p n="128">2.2. If work equipment is moving around in a work area, appropriate traffic rules must be drawn up and followed.</p>
      <p n="129">2.3. Organizational measures must be taken to prevent workers on foot coming within the area of operation of self-propelled work equipment.</p>
      <p n="130">If work can be done properly only if workers on foot are present, appropriate measures must be taken to prevent them from being injured by the equipment.</p>
      <p n="131">2.4. The transport of workers on mechanically driven mobile work equipment is authorized only where safe facilities are provided to this effect. If work must be carried out during the journey, speeds must be adjusted as necessary.</p>
      <p n="132">2.5. Mobile work equipment with a combustion engine may not be used in working areas unless sufficient quantities of air presenting no health or safety risk to workers can be guaranteed.</p>
      <p n="133">3. Provisions concerning the use of work equipment for lifting loads</p>
      <p n="134">3.1. General considerations</p>
      <p n="135">3.1.1. Work equipment which is mobile or can be dismantled and which is designed for lifting loads must be used in such a way as to ensure the stability of the work equipment during use under all foreseeable conditions, taking into account the nature of the ground.</p>
      <p n="136">3.1.2. Persons may be lifted only by means of work equipment and accessories provided for this purpose.</p>
      <p n="137">Without prejudice to Article 5 of Directive 89/391/EEC, exceptionally, work equipment which is not specifically designed for the purpose of lifting persons may be used to this effect, provided appropriate action has been taken to ensure safety in accordance with national legislation and/or practice laying down appropriate supervision.</p>
      <p n="138">While workers are on work equipment designed for lifting loads the control position must be manned at all times. Persons being lifted must have reliable means of communication. In the event of danger, there must be reliable means of evacuating them.</p>
      <p n="139">3.1.3. Unless required for the effective operation of the work, measures must be taken to ensure that workers are not present under suspended loads.</p>
      <p n="140">Loads may not be moved above unprotected workplaces usually occupied by workers.</p>
      <p n="141">Where that is the case, if work cannot be carried out properly any other way, appropriate procedures must be laid down and applied.</p>
      <p n="142">3.1.4. Lifting accessories must be selected as a function of the loads to be handled, gripping points, attachment tackle and the atmospheric conditions having regard to the mode and configuration of slinging. Lifting accessory tackle must be clearly marked so that users are aware of its characteristics where such tackle is not dismantled after use.</p>
      <p n="143">3.1.5. Lifting accessories must be stored in a way that ensures that they will not be damaged or degraded.</p>
      <p n="144">3.2. Work equipment for lifting non-guided loads</p>
      <p n="145">3.2.1. When two or more items of work equipment used for lifting non-guided loads are installed or erected on a site in such a way that their working radii overlap, appropriate measures must be taken to avoid collision between loads and/or the work equipment parts themselves.</p>
      <p n="146">3.2.2. When using mobile work equipment for lifting non-guided loads, measures must be taken to prevent the equipment from tilting, overturning or, if necessary, moving or slipping. Checks must be made to ensure that these measures are executed properly.</p>
      <p n="147">3.2.3. If the operator of work equipment designed for lifting non-guided loads cannot observe the full path of the load either directly or by means of auxiliary equipment providing the necessary information, a competent person must be in communication with the operator to guide him and organizational measures must be taken to prevent collisions of the load which could endanger workers.</p>
      <p n="148">3.2.4. Work must be organized in such a way that when a worker is attaching or detaching a load by hand, it can be done safely, in particular through the worker retaining direct or indirect control of the work equipment.</p>
      <p n="149">3.2.5. All lifting operations must be properly planned, appropriately supervised and carried out to protect the safety of workers.</p>
      <p n="150">In particular, if a load has to be lifted by two or more pieces of work equipment for lifting non-guided loads simultaneously, a procedure must be established and applied to ensure good coordination on the part of the operators.</p>
      <p n="151">3.2.6. If work equipment designed for lifting non-guided loads cannot maintain its hold on the load in the event of a complete or partial power failure, appropriate measures must be taken to avoid exposing workers to any resultant risks.</p>
      <p n="152">Suspended loads must not be left without surveillance unless access to the danger zone is prevented and the load has been safely suspended and is safely held.</p>
      <p n="153">3.2.7. Open-air use of work equipment designed for lifting non-guided loads must be halted when meteorological conditions deteriorate to the point of jeopardizing the safe use of the equipment and exposing workers to risks. Adequate protection measures, in particular, to avoid work equipment turning over must be taken to avoid any risks to workers.'</p>
