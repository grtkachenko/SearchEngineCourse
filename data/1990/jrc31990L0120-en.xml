      <p n="17">(a) The following subparagraph shall be added to (iii):</p>
      <p n="18">'however, until 30 June 1990 Member States may disregard the results of the test provided that the semen has been subjected, with a negative result, to a test for the presence of white blood cells. Member States exercising this option shall take all the necessary measures to ensure that such semen or embryos resulting therefrom do not enter into intra-Community trade;'.</p>
      <p n="19">(b) Point (iv) shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="20">'(iv) for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvo-vaginitis, a serum neutralization test or an ELISA test with a negative result. However until 31 December 1992:</p>
      <p n="21">- it is not necessary to carry out these tests on bulls which have already been subjected to such tests and have given a positive result to the serological test carried out in accordance with this Directive,</p>
      <p n="22">- vaccination against these diseases may be practised on sero-negative bulls, either with one dose of a temperature-sensitive live vaccine administered intranasally or two doses of an inactivated vaccine separated by an interval of not less than three weeks and not more than four weeks; the vaccination must be repeated subsequently at intervals of not more than six months'.</p>
      <p n="23">(c) The following shall be added to (v):</p>
      <p n="24">'However, bulls which are not used for the production of semen may be exempt from the antibody test or a culture test for campylobacter foetus infection, with the proviso that such bulls may not be re-admitted to semen production until they have been subjected to such a test or culture and given a negative result'.</p>

      <p n="28">- sero-positive bulls referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 4 (1) must be isolated, since their semen may be the subject of intra-Community trade in accordance with the provisions for trade in semen from such bulls under Article 4 (1) second, third, fourth and fifth subparagraphs.'</p>
