      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 26 June 1990 amending Directive 85/511/EEC introducing Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease, Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine and Directive 72/462/EEC on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine animals and swine and fresh meat or meat products from third countries (90/423/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Directive 85/511/EEC (4) introduced Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in view of the completion of the internal market for 1 January 1993, it is necessary to amend the measures already taken at Community level to control foot-and-mouth disease in the entire Community; whereas it is essential that a uniform policy should be implemented throughout the Community;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas a Commission study on control of foot-and-mouth disease has shown that the adoption of a non-vaccination policy for the Community as a whole would be preferable to a vaccination policy; whereas it has been concluded that a risk exists in the manipulation of virus in laboratories due to the possibility of escape to local susceptible animals and in the use of vaccine if inactivation procedures do not ensure its safety;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the Commission's study as regards a vaccination policy for the future has clearly shown that an official withdrawal of vaccination against the disease should be implemented from a given date and that such withdrawal should be accompanied by a policy of total slaughter and destruction (stamping out) of infected animals;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas Commission Decision 88/379/EEC of 12 July 1988 coordinating rules laid down by Member States</p>
      <p n="13">in application of Article 6 of Council Directive 85/511/EEC (5) has already provided for a minimum set of</p>
      <p n="14">rules to be applied in all Member States when granting exceptions from total slaughter on an infected holding;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas, in extreme situations where an epizootic disease threatens to become extensive, it may be necessary to have recourse to emergency vaccination; whereas it is necessary to lay down conditions under which this vaccination may be carried out;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas the adoption of a uniform Community policy in the campaign against foot-and-mouth disease involves an adjustment of the rules governing intra-Community trade in live animals and the import, from third countries, of live animals and certain animal products;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas financial support to Member States concerning slaughter, destruction and other emergency actions should be laid down in separate measures;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas the functioning of the new measures must be kept under the review of the Commission, which shall report to the Council annually on their implementation,</p>
      <p n="19">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="20">Article 1</p>
      <p n="21">Directive 85/511/EEC is hereby amended as follows:</p>

      <p n="32">(c)</p>
      <p n="33">paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="34">'2. When recourse is had to paragraph 1, Member States shall apply the measures specified in Commission Decision 88/397/EEC (*).</p>

      <p n="36">4. In Article 9:</p>
      <p n="37">(a) the last sentence of paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="38">'The definition of zones shall take account of natural boundaries, supervision facilities and technological progress which make it possible to foresee the possible dispersion of the virus by air or any other means and will have to be reviewed, if necessary, in the light of such elements.'</p>
      <p n="39">(b) in paragraph 2 (a), the first indent is replaced by the two following indents:</p>
      <p n="40">'- a census of all the holdings with animals of susceptible species must be carried out,</p>
      <p n="41">'- holdings which are the subject of such a census must periodically undergo a veterinary inspection,'.</p>
      <p n="42">5. In Article 11 (1), first and second indents, 'Annex' and 'Annex I' are replaced each time by 'Annex B'.</p>
      <p n="43">6. Article 13 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="44">'Article 13</p>
      <p n="45">1. Member States shall ensure that:</p>
      <p n="46">- the use of foot-and-mouth vaccines is prohibited,</p>
      <p n="47">- the manipulation of foot-and-mouth virus for research, diagnosis and/or manufacture of vaccines shall be carried out only in approved establishments and laboratories listed in Annex A and B,</p>

      <p n="50">2. Veterinary experts from the Commission, in collaboration with the competent authorities of the Member States, shall carry out spot-checks to ascertain whether the security systems applied in the establishments and laboratories referred to in Annexes A and B comply with the FAO's minimum standards.</p>
      <p n="51">The Commission shall carry out these checks at least once a year, the first of these checks being due before 1 January 1992, and shall submit, also before that date, an initial report to the Standing Veterinary Committee. The list of establishments and laboratories in Annexes A and B may be reviewed in the light of these checks by the Commission, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 17, by 31 December 1991. The list will be regularly updated in accordance with the same procedure.</p>
      <p n="52">In accordance with the same procedure, a decision may be taken to adopt a uniform code of good conduct for the security systems applied in the establishments and laboratories listed in Annexes A and B.</p>
      <p n="53">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 concerning the use of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine, it may be decided, when foot-and-mouth disease has been confirmed and threatens to become extensive, that emergency vaccination using technical procedures guaranteeing the animals' total immunity may be introduced. In this case, the measures to be taken shall include:</p>
      <p n="54">- the extent of the geographical area in which emergency vaccination is to be carried out,</p>

      <p n="58">- the special identification and special registration of the vaccinated animals,</p>
      <p n="59">- other matters appropriate to the emergency situation.</p>
      <p n="60">The decision to introduce emergency vaccination shall be taken by the Commission in collaboration with the Member State concerned, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16. This decision shall have particular regard to the degree of concentration of animals in certain regions and the need to protect special breeds.</p>
      <p n="61">However, by way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the decision to introduce emergency vaccination around the outbreak may be taken by the Member State concerned following notification to the Commission, provided that basic Community interests are not endangered. This decision shall be immediately reviewed in the Standing Veterinary Committee in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16.'</p>
      <p n="62">7. Article 14 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="63">'Article 14</p>
