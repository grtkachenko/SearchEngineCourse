      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3492/90 of 27 November 1990 laying down the factors to be taken into consideration in the annual accounts for the financing of intervention measures in the form of public storage by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2048/88 (2), and in particular Article 3 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 787/89 (4), lays down the general rules for the financing by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, (EAGGF) Guarantee Section, of intervention measures;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3247/81 of 9 November 1981 on the financing by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section, of certain intervention measures, particularly those involving the buying-in, storage and sale of agricultural products by intervention agencies (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3767/89 (6), lays down the rules and conditions governing the annual accounts, which enable the expenditure to be financed by the EAGGF, Guarantee Section, for the intervention measures concerning public storage to be established; however, in the light of experience it is necessary to simplify the existing procedure and to provide that the rules of implementation should be fixed in accordance with a simplified procedure; whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3247/81 should be repealed;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, under the agricultural Regulations, intervention agencies buy in products offered for intervention; whereas more detailed rules are needed with regard to the responsibility for the preservation of stored products; whereas the inventories of products stored should be drawn up at regular intervals in order to compare them with stock and financial accounts; whereas financing rules should be laid down to cover quantity losses, deterioration of products, transport of products offered for intervention and recovery of sums from sellers, purchasers and storers;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Article 37 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1325/90 (8), provides that the costs of disposal of products of distillation as provided for in Articles 35 and 36 of that Regulation are to be borne by the EAGGF Guarantee Section; whereas more detailed rules with regard to this measure of disposal are needed;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the adoption of detailed implementing rules and the procedure to be followed in that case should be provided for,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">1. The annual accounts shall be drawn up for each product which is subject to public storage intervention measures.</p>

      <p n="18">(c) differences between the value of quantities carried over from the previous year and the value of quantities entered, taking account of the depreciation referred to at (d) on the one hand and the value of the quantities removed and the value of quantities carried over to the following year on the other hand, and any other expenditure or revenue;</p>
      <p n="19">(d) the amounts resulting from the depreciation provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78.</p>
      <p n="20">The expenditure referred to at (a) and the other expenditure and receipts referred to at (c) are listed in the Annex.</p>

      <p n="30">Article 4</p>
      <p n="31">1. A tolerance limit may be fixed for losses attributable to the preservation of the products stored.</p>

      <p n="35">4. The limits referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 after consideration, where necessary, by the management committee concerned.</p>
      <p n="36">Article 5</p>
      <p n="37">1. All missing quantities and quantities which have deteriorated because of the physical conditions of storage, transport, processing or by reason of overlong preservation shall be recorded in the accounts as having left the intervention stock on the date when the loss or deterioration was established.</p>
      <p n="38">2. The value of the quantities referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8.</p>
      <p n="39">3. Unless otherwise provided for by Community rules, any revenue from the sale of deteriorated products and any other receipts in this connection shall not be entered in the accounts.</p>

      <p n="41">5. The Member State shall inform the Commission of quantity losses or deterioration of the product caused by natural disaster. The Commission shall then adopt appropriate decisions according to the procedure laid down in Article 8.</p>
