      <p n="55">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="56">Conditions for the pursuit of fishing activities by Community vessels in Tanzania's fishing zone</p>

Each application shall be acompanied by documentary proof of payment of the appropriate licence fee. The application shall be made on the forms provided for that purpose by Tanzania, a specimen of which is at Appendix 1.</p>
      <p n="59">(b) Every licence shall be issued to the shipowner for one designated vessel. At the request of the Commission of the European Communities, the licence for a vessel may and in cases of force majeure will be replaced by a licence for another Community vessel having the same characteristics, In the latter case, no fee is due for the remaining period of validity.</p>

      <p n="67">The final statement of the fees due for the fishing year in respect of each vessel shall be drawn up by the Commission of the European Communities on the basis of the catch statements made by the shipowners (a specimen of which is at Appendix 2), confirmed by the scientific institutes responsible for verification of the catch figures (Orstom and the Spanish Oceanographic Institute). Any additional payment due shall be paid by the shipowners within 30 days into an account specified by the Tanzanian authorities.</p>

      <p n="129">1. Pursuant to Article 2 of the Agreement, and for a period of three years from the date of its entry into force, the following fishing possibilities shall be accorded:</p>
      <p n="130">- for ocean-going tuna seiners: licences for 46 vessels,</p>
      <p n="131">- for surface longliners fishing for tuna and other migratory species: licences for eight vessels.</p>
      <p n="132">2. In addition, consideration will be given, at the first or at a subsequent meeting of the joint committee referred to in Article 8 of the Agreement, to granting authorization for fishing possibilities for demersal and crustacean species on terms to be established by that committee including the corresponding Community financial compensation.</p>
      <p n="133">Article 2</p>
      <p n="134">1. The financial compensation referred to in Article 7 of the Agreement should be set at ECU 1 050 000 for the duration of this Protocol, to be paid in three equal annual instalments.</p>
      <p n="135">2. This amount shall cover the fishing activities referred to in Article 1 of the Agreement up to a catch-weight in Tanzania's fishing zone of 7 000 tonnes of tuna and other migratory species fished per year. If the annual amount caught by Community vessels in Tanzania's fishing zone exceeds this quantity, the abovementioned compensations shall be increased by ECU 50 for each additional tonne caught.</p>
      <p n="136">3. The use to which this compensation is put shall be the sole competence of Tanzania.</p>
      <p n="137">4. The financial compensation shall be paid into an account opened at a financial institution or other body designated by Tanzania.</p>
