      <p n="4">of 10 May 1990</p>
      <p n="5">laying down the criteria governing entry in flock-books for pure-bred breeding sheep and goats</p>
      <p n="6">(90/255/EEC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 89/361/EEC of 30 May 1989 concerning pure-bred breeding sheep and goats (1), and in particular the second indent of Article 4 thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas in all Member States flock-books are maintained or established by breeders' organizations, or associations or official services;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas it is therefore necessary to lay down the criteria for the entering of pure-breed breeding sheep and goats in flock-books;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas precise conditions relating to lineage and identification must be fulfilled prior to entry in the flock-books;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas allowances should be made for the division of the flock-book into different classes so that certain types of animals will not be excluded;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Zootechnics,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">To qualify for entry in the main section of the book of its breed a pure-bred breeding sheep or goat must:</p>
      <p n="18">- be descended from parents and grandparents entered in a flock-book of that same breed,</p>
      <p n="19">- be identified after birth according to the rules of the book,</p>
      <p n="20">- have a pedigree established in accordance with the rules of the book.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>
      <p n="22">The main section of the flock-book may be divided into several classes according to the animals' characteristics. Only pure-bred breeding sheep and goats meeting the criteria laid down in Article 1 may be entered in one of the classes.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
      <p n="24">1. A breeders' organization or association keeping a flock-book may decide that a female which does not met the criteria laid down in Article 1 may be entered in an annex to the flock-book. The female must meet the following requirements:</p>
      <p n="25">- be identified after birth in accordance with the flock-book rules,</p>
      <p n="26">- be judged to conform to the breed standard,</p>
      <p n="27">- have minimum characteristics as laid down by the flock-book rules.</p>
      <p n="28">2. A female whose mother and maternal grandmother are entered in the annex to the flock-book as provided for in paragraph 1 and whose father and two grandfathers are entered in the main section of the book in accordance with Article 1, is regarded as a pure-bred female and entered in the main section of the book, as provided for in Article 1.</p>
      <p n="29">3. The requirements mentioned in the second and third indents of paragraph 1 may be differentiated according to whether the female belongs to the breed but has no known origin or was obtained from a crossing programme approved by the breeders' organizations or associations.</p>
      <p n="30">Article 4</p>
      <p n="31">A breeder's organization or association keeping a flock-book may decide that a male which does not meet the criteria laid down in Article 1, may be entered in an annex to the flock book. The male must meet the following requirements:</p>
      <p n="32">- be identified after birth in accordance with the flock-book rules,</p>
      <p n="33">- be judged to conform to the breed standard,</p>
      <p n="34">- have minimum characteristics as laid down by the flock-book rules.</p>
      <p n="35">- fulfil the conditions laid down in the Annex hereto.</p>
      <p n="36">Article 5</p>
      <p n="37">Where a book contains several classes, a pure-bred breeding sheep or goat from another flock-book of the same breed and having specific characteristics distinguishing it</p>
      <p n="38">from the population of the same breed in the flock-book of destination shall be entered in the section of the book whose characteristics it meets.</p>
      <p n="39">Article 6</p>
      <p n="40">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="41">Done at Brussels, 10 May 1990.</p>
