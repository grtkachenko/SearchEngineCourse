      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EEC) No 2343/90 of 24 July 1990 on access for air carriers to scheduled intra-Community air service routes and on the sharing of passenger capacity between air carriers on scheduled air services between Member States</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2343/90 of 24 July 1990 on access for air carriers to scheduled intra-Community air service routes and on the sharing of passenger capacity between air carriers on scheduled air services between Member States</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 84 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas it is important to adopt measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992 as provided for in Article 8a of the Treaty; whereas the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Decision 87/602/EEC (4) made a first step towards the liberalization in respect of sharing of passenger capacity and access to the market, necessary to achieve the internal market in air transport; whereas the Council agreed to take further measures of liberalization at the end of a three-year initial period;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas it is necessary to implement principles governing relations between States of registration and air carriers licensed in their territory by 1 July 1992 on the basis of common specifications and criteria;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas arrangements for greater cooperation over the use of Gibraltar airport were agreed in London on 2 December 1987 by the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom in a joint declaration by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries, and such arrangements have yet to come into operation;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the development of the air traffic system in the Greek Islands and in the Atlantic Islands comprising the autonomous region of the Azores is at present inadequate and for this reason airports situated on these islands should be temporarily exempted from the application of this Regulation;</p>
      <p n="13">OJ No C 164, 5. 7. 1990, p. 11.</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the infrastructure at Porto airport is still being expanded to enable it to cope with the growth in scheduled services; whereas, consequently, that airport should be exempted temporarily from the application of this Regulation until the expansion of this infrastructure is completed;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas it is necessary to make special provision, under limited circumstances, for air services on new routes between regional airports and for public service obligations necessary for the maintenance of services to certain regional airports;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas increased market access will stimulate the development of the Community air transport sector and give rise to improved services for users; whereas as a consequence it is necessary to introduce more liberal provisions concerning multiple designation, third-, fourth- and fifth-freedom traffic rights;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas, taking into account problems relating to airport infrastructure, navigational aids and availability of slots, it is necessary to include certain limitations concerning the use of traffic rights;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas the exercise of traffic rights has to be consistent with rules relating to safety, protection of the environment, allocation of slots and conditions concerning airport access and has to be treated without discrimination on grounds of nationality;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas bilateral rules concerning capacity shares are not compatible with the principles of the internal market which should be completed by 1993 in the air transport sector; whereas therefore the bilateral restrictions must be diminished gradually;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas it is especially important to encourage the development of inter-regional services in order to develop the Community network and to contribute to a solution of the problem of congestion at certain large airports; whereas, therefore, it is appropriate to have more liberal rules with respect to capacity sharing these services;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas in view of the relative importance for some Member States of non-scheduled traffic vis-Ã -vis scheduled traffic, it is necessary to take measures to alleviate its impact on the opportunities of carriers of Member States receiving such traffic; whereas the measures to be taken should not be aimed at limiting non-scheduled traffic or subjecting it to regulation;</p>
      <p n="22">Whereas, taking into account the competitive market situation, provision should be made to prevent unjustifiable economic effects on air carriers;</p>
      <p n="23">Whereas this Regulation replaces Directive 83/416/</p>
      <p n="24">EEC (5), as last amended by Directive 89/463/EEC (6),</p>
      <p n="25">and Decision 87/602/EEC; whereas it is therefore necessary to revoke that Directive and that Decision;</p>
      <p n="26">Whereas it is desirable that the Council adopt further measures of liberalization including cobotage in respect of market access and capacity sharing by 30 June 1992,</p>
      <p n="27">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="28">Scope and definitions</p>
      <p n="29">Article 1</p>
      <p n="30">1. This Regulation concerns:</p>

      <p n="32">(b) the sharing of passenger capacity between the air carrier(s) licensed in one Member State and the air carrier(s) licensed in another Member State on scheduled air services between these States.</p>
      <p n="33">2. The application of this Regulation to the airport of Gibraltar is understood to be without prejudice to the respective legal positions of the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom with regard to the dispute over sovereignty over the territory in which the airport is situated.</p>
      <p n="34">3. Application of the provisions of this Regulation to Gibraltar airport shall be suspended until the arrangements in the joint declaration made by the Foreign Ministers of the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom on 2 December 1987 have come into operation. The Governments of Spain and the United Kingdom will so inform the Council on that date.</p>
      <p n="35">4. Airports in the Greek islands and in the Atlantic islands comprising the autonomous region of the Azores shall be exempted from the application of this Regulation until 30 June 1993. Unless otherwise decided by the Council, on a proposal of the Commission, this exemption shall apply for a further period of five years and may be continued for five years thereafter.</p>
      <p n="36">The airport of Porto shall be exempted from the application of this Regulation until 31 December 1992. This derogation shall be rescinded as soon as the Portuguese Republic judges that the economic conditions of the airport have improved.</p>
      <p n="37">To this end, the Portuguese Republic shall inform the Commission. The Commission shall communicate this information to the other Member States.</p>

Where an air carrier of one Member State has been licensed in accordance with this Article to operate a scheduled air service, the State of registration of that air carrier shall raise no objection to an application for the introduction of a scheduled air service on the same route by an air carrier of the other State concerned.</p>
      <p n="94">3. (a) A Member State, following consultations with other States concerned, may impose a public service obligation in respect of air services to a regional</p>

      <p n="118">Article 7</p>
      <p n="119">In operating scheduled air services to or from two or more points in another Member State or States other than its State of registration, a Community air carrier shall be permitted by the States concerned to combine scheduled air services and use the same flight number. Traffic rights between the combined points may be exercised according to Article 8.</p>
      <p n="120">Fifth-freedom rights</p>
      <p n="121">Article 8</p>
      <p n="122">1. Community air carriers shall, in accordance with this Article, be permitted to exercise fifth-freedom traffic rights between combined points in two different Member States on the following conditions:</p>
      <p n="123">(a) the traffic rights are exercised on a service which constitutes and is scheduled as an extension of a service from, or as a preliminary of a service to, their State of registration;</p>
      <p n="124">(b)</p>
      <p n="125">the air carrier cannot use, for the fifth-freedom service more than 50 % of its seasonal seat capacity on the same third- and fourth-freedom service of which the fifth-freedom service constitutes the extension or the preliminary.</p>
      <p n="126">2. (a) The air carrier may, for a fifth-freedom service, use an aircraft which is different to but not larger than the aircraft which it uses for the third- and fourth-freedom service of which the fifth-freedom service is an extension or a preliminary.</p>
      <p n="127">(b) When more than one fifth-freedom service is operated as an extension of or as a preliminary to a third- or fourth-freedom service, the capacity provision in paragraph 1 (b) shall represent the aggregate seat capacity available for the carriage of fifth-freedom passengers on those fifth-freedom services.</p>
      <p n="128">3. An air carrier operating a fifth-freedom service in accordance with this Article shall furnish on request to</p>
      <p n="129">the Member States involved all relevant information concerning:</p>
      <p n="130">(a) the seasonal seat capacity on the third- and fourth-freedom service of which the fifth-freedom service constitutes the extension or the preliminary; and</p>
      <p n="131">(b)</p>
      <p n="132">in the case of fifth-freedom services to which Article 8 (2) (b) applies, the seasonal capacity utilized on each service.</p>
      <p n="133">Conditions for the exercise of traffic rights</p>
      <p n="134">Article 9</p>
      <p n="135">This Regulation shall not affect a Member States' right to regulate without discrimination on grounds of nationality, the distribution of traffic between the airports within an airport system.</p>
      <p n="136">Article 10</p>
      <p n="137">1. Notwithstanding Article 5 (2), the exercise of traffic rights is subject to published Community, national, regional or local rules relating to safety, the protection of the environment and the allocation of slots, and to the following conditions:</p>
      <p n="138">(a) the airport or airport system concerned must have sufficient facilities to accommodate the service;</p>
      <p n="139">(b)</p>
      <p n="140">navigational aids must be sufficient to accommodate the service.</p>
      <p n="141">2. When the conditions in paragraph 1 are not met, a Member State may, without discrimination on grounds of nationality, impose conditions on, limit or refuse the exercise of those traffic rights. Before taking such a measure, a Member State shall inform the Commission and provide it with all the necessary elements of information.</p>
      <p n="142">3. Without prejudice to Article 9 and except with the agreement of the other Member State(s) concerned, a Member State shall not authorize an air carrier:</p>
      <p n="143">(a) to establish a new service; or</p>
      <p n="144">(b)</p>
      <p n="145">to increase the frequency of an existing service</p>
      <p n="146">between a specific airport in its territory and another Member State for such time as an air carrier licensed by that other Member State is not permitted, on the basis of paragraphs 1 and 2, to establish a new service or to increase frequencies on an existing service to the airport in question, pending the adoption by the Council and the coming into force of a Regulation on a code of conduct on slot allocation based on the general principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality.</p>
      <p n="147">4. At the request of any Member State, the Commission shall examine the application of paragraph 2 and/or paragraph 3 in any particular case and within one month decide whether the Member State may continue to apply the measure.</p>
      <p n="148">5. The Commission shall communicate its decision to the Council and to the Member States. Any Member State may refer the Commission's decision to the Council within a time limit of one month. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may take a different decision within a period of one month.</p>
      <p n="149">Shares of capacity</p>
      <p n="150">Article 11</p>
      <p n="151">1. From 1 November 1990, a Member State shall permit another Member State to increase its capacity share for any season by 7,5 percentage points compared to the situation during the previous corresponding season, it being understood that each Member State may in any event claim a capacity share of 60 %.</p>
      <p n="152">2. The Council shall adopt, for implementation not later than 1 January 1993, on the basis of a Commission proposal</p>
      <p n="153">to be submitted by 31 December 1991, provisions to abolish capacity sharing restrictions between Member States.</p>
      <p n="154">3. Capacity sharing limitations shall not apply to a service between regional airports irrespective of aircraft capacity.</p>
      <p n="155">4. In applying paragraph 1, unilateral cut-backs in capacity shall not be taken into account. In such cases, the basis for the calculation of capacity shares shall be the capacity offered in the previous corresponding seasons by the air carrier(s) of the Member State which has (have ) reduced its (their) capacity.</p>
      <p n="156">Article 12</p>
      <p n="157">1. At the request of any Member State for which the application of Article 11 has led to serious financial damage for the air carrier(s) licensed by that Member State, the Commission shall carry out a review and, on the basis of all relevant factors, including the market situation, the financial position of the air carrier(s) concerned and the capacity utilization achieved, shall take a decision on whether the capacity sharing on the routes to or from that State should be stabilized for a limited period.</p>
      <p n="158">2. At the request of a Member State whose scheduled air services are exposed to substantial competition from non-scheduled services and where a situation exists whereby the opportunities of carriers of that Member State to effectively compete in the market are unduly affected, the Commission, having examined all relevant factors, including the market situation and the capacity utilization achieved, and having consulted the other Member States concerned shall, within two months of having received the request, decide whether the 7,5 percentage points referred to in Article 11 (1) shall be reduced for that bilateral relationship.</p>
      <p n="159">3. The Commission shall communicate its decision to the Council and to the Member States. Any Member State may refer the Commission's decision to the Council within a time limit of one month. The Council, acting by qualified majority, may take a different decision within a period of one month.</p>
      <p n="160">General provisions</p>
      <p n="161">Article 13</p>
      <p n="162">1. This Regulation shall not prevent Member States from concluding between them arrangements which are more flexible than the provisions of Articles 6, 8 and 11 or from maintaining such arrangements in force.</p>
      <p n="163">2. The provisions of this Regulation shall not be used to make existing market access or capacity arrangements more restrictive.</p>
      <p n="164">Article 14</p>
      <p n="165">1. The Commission shall publish a report on the implementation of this Regulation every two years and for the first time not later than 31 May 1992.</p>
      <p n="166">2. Member States and the Commission shall cooperate</p>
      <p n="167">in implementing this Regulation, particularly as regards collection of information for the report referred to in paragraph 1.</p>
