      <p n="2">*****</p>
      <p n="3">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE</p>
      <p n="4">of 13 June 1990</p>
      <p n="5">on package travel, package holidays and package tours</p>
      <p n="6">(90/314/EEC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="10">In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="11">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas one of the main objectives of the Community is to complete the internal market, of which the tourist sector is an essential part;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the national laws of Member States concerning package travel, package holidays and package tours, hereinafter referred to as 'packages', show many disparities and national practices in this field are markedly different, which gives rise to obstacles to the freedom to provide services in respect of packages and distortions of competition amongst operators established in different Member States;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the establishment of common rules on packages will contribute to the elimination of these obstacles and thereby to the achievement of a common market in services, thus enabling operators established in one Member State to offer their services in other Member States and Community consumers to benefit from comparable conditions when buying a package in any Member State;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas paragraph 36 (b) of the Annex to the Council resolution of 19 May 1981 on a second programme of the European Economic Community for a consumer protection and information policy (4) invites the Commission to study, inter alia, tourism and, if appropriate, to put forward suitable proposals, with due regard for their significance for consumer protection and the effects of differences in Member States' legislation on the proper functioning of the common market;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas in the resolution on a Community policy on tourism on 10 April 1984 (5) the Council welcomed the Commission's initiative in drawing attention to the importance of tourism and took note of the Commission's initial guidelines for a Community policy on tourism;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas the Commission communication to the Council entitled 'A New Impetus for Consumer Protection Policy', which was approved by resolution of the Council on 6 May 1986 (6), lists in paragraph 37, among the measures proposed by the Commission, the harmonization of legislation on packages;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas tourism plays an increasingly important role in the economies of the Member States; whereas the package system is a fundamental part of tourism; whereas the package travel industry in Member States would be stimulated to greater growth and productivity if at least a minimum of common rules were adopted in order to give it a Community dimension; whereas this would not only produce benefits for Community citizens buying packages organized on the basis of those rules, but would attract tourists from outside the Community seeking the advantages of guaranteed standards in packages;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas disparities in the rules protecting consumers in different Member States are a disincentive to consumers in one Member State from buying packages in another Member State;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas this disincentive is particularly effective in deterring consumers from buying packages outside their own Member State, and more effective than it would be in relation to the acquisition of other services, having regard to the special nature of the services supplied in a package which generally involve the expenditure of substantial amounts of money in advance and the supply of the services in a State other than that in which the consumer is resident;</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas the consumer should have the benefit of the protection introduced by this Directive irrespective of whether he is a direct contracting party, a transferee or a member of a group on whose behalf another person has concluded a contract in respect of a package;</p>
      <p n="22">Whereas the organizer of the package and/or the retailer of it should be under obligation to ensure that in descriptive matter relating to packages which they respectively</p>
      <p n="23">organize and sell, the information which is given is not misleading and brochures made available to consumers contain information which is comprehensible and accurate;</p>
      <p n="24">Whereas the consumer needs to have a record of the terms of contract applicable to the package; whereas this can conveniently be achieved by requiring that all the terms of the contract be stated in writing of such other documentary form as shall be comprehensible and accessible to him, and that he be given a copy thereof;</p>
      <p n="25">Whereas the consumer should be at liberty in certain circumstances to transfer to a willing third person a booking made by him for a package;</p>
      <p n="26">Whereas the price established under the contract should not in principle be subject to revision except where the possibility of upward or downward revision is expressly provided for in the contract; whereas that possibility should nonetheless be subject to certain conditions;</p>
      <p n="27">Whereas the consumer should in certain circumstances be free to withdraw before departure from a package travel contract;</p>
      <p n="28">Whereas there should be a clear definition of the rights available to the the consumer in circumstances where the organizer of the package cancels it before the agreed date of departure;</p>
      <p n="29">Whereas if, after the consumer has departed, there occurs a significant failure of performance of the services for which he has contracted or the organizer perceives that he will be unable to procure a significant part of the services to be provided; the organizer should have certain obligations towards the consumer;</p>
      <p n="30">Whereas the organizer and/or retailer party to the contract should be liable to the consumer for the proper performance of the obligations arising from the contract; whereas, moreover, the organizer and/or retailer should be liable for the damage resulting for the consumer from failure to perform or improper performance of the contract unless the defects in the performance of the contract are attributable neither to any fault of theirs nor to that of another supplier of services;</p>
      <p n="31">Whereas in cases where the organizer and/or retailer is liable for failure to perform or improper performance of the services involved in the package, such liability should be limited in accordance with the international conventions governing such services, in particular the Warsaw Convention of 1929 in International Carriage by Air, the Berne Convention of 1961 on Carriage by Rail, the Athens Convention of 1974 on Carriage by Sea and the Paris Convention of 1962 on the Liability of Hotel-keepers; whereas, moreover, with regard to damage other than personal injury, it should be possible for liability also to be limited under the package contract provided, however, that such limits are not unreasonable;</p>
      <p n="32">Whereas certain arrangements should be made for the information of consumers and the handling of complaints;</p>
      <p n="33">Whereas both the consumer and the package travel industry would benefit if organizers and/or retailers were placed under an obligation to provide sufficient evidence of security in the event of insolvency;</p>
      <p n="34">Whereas Member States should be at liberty to adopt, or retain, more stringent provisions relating to package travel for the purpose of protecting the consumer,</p>
      <p n="35">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="36">Article 1</p>
      <p n="37">The purpose of this Directive is to approximate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to packages sold or offered for sale in the territory of the Community.</p>
      <p n="38">Article 2</p>
      <p n="39">For the purposes of this Directive:</p>
      <p n="40">1. 'package' means the pre-arranged combination of not fewer than two of the following when sold or offered for sale at an inclusive price and when the service covers a period of more than twenty-four hours or includes overnight accommodation:</p>
      <p n="41">(a) transport;</p>
      <p n="42">(b) accommodation;</p>
      <p n="43">(c) other tourist services not ancillary to transport or accommodation and accounting for a significant proportion of the package.</p>
      <p n="44">The separate billing of various components of the same package shall not absolve the organizer or retailer from the obligations under this Directive;</p>
      <p n="45">2. 'organizer' means the person who, other than ocasionally, organizes packages and sells or offers them for sale, whether directly or through a retailer;</p>
      <p n="46">3. 'retailer' means the person who sells or offers for sale the package put together by the organizer;</p>
      <p n="47">4. 'consumer' means the person who takes or agrees to take the package ('the principal contractor'), or any person on whose behalf the principal contractor agrees to purchase the package ('the other beneficiaries') or any person to whom the principal contractor or any of the other beneficiaries transfers the package ('the transferee');</p>
      <p n="48">5. 'contract' means the agreement linking the consumer to the organizer and/or the retailer.</p>
      <p n="49">Article 3</p>
      <p n="50">1. Any descriptive matter concerning a package and supplied by the organizer or the retailer to the consumer, the price of the package and any other conditions applying to the contract must not contain any misleading information. 2. When a brochure is made available to the consumer, it shall indicate in a legible, comprehensible and accurate manner both the price and adequate information concerning:</p>
      <p n="51">(a) the destination and the means, characteristics and categories of transport used;</p>
      <p n="52">(b) the type of accommodation, its location, category or degree of comfort and its main features, its approval and tourist classification under the rules of the host Member State concerned;</p>
      <p n="53">(c) the meal plan;</p>
      <p n="54">(d) the itinerary;</p>
      <p n="55">(e) general information on passport and visa requirements for nationals of the Member State or States concerned and health formalities required for the journey and the stay;</p>
      <p n="56">(f) either the monetary amount or the percentage of the price which is to be paid on account, and the timetable for payment of the balance;</p>
      <p n="57">(g) whether a minimum number of persons is required for the package to take place and, if so, the deadline for informing the consumer in the event of cancellation.</p>
      <p n="58">The particulars contained in the brochure are binding on the organizer or retailer, unless:</p>
      <p n="59">- changes in such particulars have been clearly communicated to the consumer before conclusion of the contract, in which case the brochure shall expressly state so,</p>
      <p n="60">- changes are made later following an agreement between the parties to the contract.</p>
      <p n="61">Article 4</p>
      <p n="62">1. (a) The organizer and/or the retailer shall provide the consumer, in writing or any other appropriate form, before the contract is concluded, with general information on passport and visa requirements applicable to nationals of the Member State or States concerned and in particular on the periods for obtaining them, as well as with information on the health formalities required for the journey and the stay;</p>
      <p n="63">(b) The organizer and/or retailer shall also provide the consumer, in writing or any other appropriate form, with the following information in good time before the start of the journey:</p>
      <p n="64">(i) the times and places of intermediate stops and transport connections as well as details of the place to be occupied by the traveller, e.g. cabin or berth on ship, sleeper compartment on train;</p>
      <p n="65">(ii) the name, address and telephone number of the organizer's and/or retailer's local representative or, failing that, of local agencies on whose assistance a consumer in difficulty could call.</p>
      <p n="66">Where no such representatives or agencies exist, the consumer must in any case be provided with an emergency telephone number or any other information that will enable him to contract the organizer and/or the retailer;</p>
      <p n="67">(iii) in the case of journeys or stays abroad by minors, information enabling direct contact to be established with the child or the person responsible at the child's place of stay;</p>
      <p n="68">(iv) information on the optional conclusion of an insurance policy to cover the cost of cancellation by the consumer or the cost of assistance, including repatriation, in the event of accident or illness.</p>
      <p n="69">2. Member States shall ensure that in relation to the contract the following principles apply:</p>
      <p n="70">(a) depending on the particular package, the contract shall contain at least the elements listed in the Annex;</p>
      <p n="71">(b) all the terms of the contract are set out in writing or such other form as is comprehensible and accessible to the consumer and must be communicated to him before the conclusion of the contract; the consumer is given a copy of these terms;</p>
      <p n="72">(c) the provision under (b) shall not preclude the belated conclusion of last-minute reservations or contracts.</p>
      <p n="73">3. Where the consumer is prevented from proceeding with the package, he may transfer his booking, having first given the organizer or the retailer reasonable notice of his intention before departure, to a person who satisfies all the conditions applicable to the package. The transferor of the package and the transferee shall be jointly and severally liable to the organizer or retailer party to the contract for payment of the balance due and for any additional costs arising from such transfer.</p>
      <p n="74">4. (a) The prices laid down in the contract shall not be subject to revision unless the contract expressly provides for the possibility of upward or downward revision and states precisely how the revised price is to be calculated, and solely to allow for variations in:</p>
      <p n="75">- transportation costs, including the cost of fuel,</p>
      <p n="76">- dues, taxes or fees chargeable for certain services, such as landing taxes or embarkation or disembarkation fees at ports and airports,</p>
      <p n="77">- the exchange rates applied to the particular package.</p>
      <p n="78">(b) During the twenty days prior to the departure date stipulated, the price stated in the contract shall not be increased.</p>
      <p n="79">5. If the organizer finds that before the departure he is constrained to alter significantly any of the essential terms, such as the price, he shall notify the consumer as quickly as possible in order to enable him to take appropriate decisions and in particular:</p>
      <p n="80">- either to withdraw from the contract without penalty,</p>
      <p n="81">- or to accept a rider to the contract specifying the alterations made and their impact on the price.</p>
      <p n="82">The consumer shall inform the organizer or the retailer of his decision as soon as possible.</p>
      <p n="83">6. If the consumer withdraws from the contract pursuant to paragraph 5, or if, for whatever cause, other than the fault of the consumer, the organizer cancels the package before the agreed date of departure, the consumer shall be entitled:</p>
      <p n="84">(a) either to take a substitute package of equivalent or higher quality where the organizer and/or retailer is able to offer him such a substitute. If the replacement package offered is of lower quality, the organizer shall refund the difference in price to the consumer;</p>
      <p n="85">(b) or to be repaid as soon as possible all sums paid by him under the contract.</p>
      <p n="86">In such a case, he shall be entitled, if appropriate, to be compensated by either the organizer or the retailer, whichever the relevant Member State's law requires, for non-performance of the contract, except where:</p>
      <p n="87">(i) cancellation is on the grounds that the number of persons enrolled for the package is less than the minimum number required and the consumer is informed of the cancellation, in writing, within the period indicated in the package description; or</p>
      <p n="88">(ii) cancellation, excluding overbooking, is for reasons of force majeure, i.e. unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of the party by whom it is pleaded, the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised.</p>
      <p n="89">7. Where, after departure, a significant proportion of the services contracted for is not provided or the organizer perceives that he will be unable to procure a significant proportion of the services to be provided, the organizer shall make suitable alternative arrangements, at no extra cost to the consumer, for the continuation of the packag, and where appropriate compensate the consumer for the difference between the services offered and those supplied.</p>
      <p n="90">If it is impossible to make such arrangements or these are not accepted by the consumer for good reasons, the organizer shall, where appropriate, provide the consumer, at no extra cost, with equivalent transport back to the place of departure, or to another return-point to which the consumer has agreed and shall, where appropriate, compensate the consumer.</p>
      <p n="91">Article 5</p>
      <p n="92">1. Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the organizer and/or retailer party to the contract is liable to the consumer for the proper performance of the obligations arising from the contract, irrespective of whether such obligations are to be performed by that organizer and/or retailer or by other suppliers of services without prejudice to the right of the organizer and/or retailer to pursue those other suppliers of services.</p>
      <p n="93">2. With regard to the damage resulting for the consumer from the failure to perform or the improper performance of the contract, Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the organizer and/or retailer is/are liable unless such failure to perform or improper performance is attributable neither to any fault of theirs nor to that of another supplier of services, because:</p>
      <p n="94">- the failures which occur in the performance of the contract are attributable to the consumer,</p>
      <p n="95">- such failures are attributable to a third party unconnected with the provision of the services contracted for, and are unforeseeable or unavoidable,</p>
      <p n="96">- such failures are due to a case of force majeure such as that defined in Article 4 (6), second subparagraph (ii), or to an event which the organizer and/or retailer or the supplier of services, even with all due care, could not foresee or forestall.</p>
      <p n="97">In the cases referred to in the second and third indents, the organizer and/or retailer party to the contract shall be required to give prompt assistance to a consumer in difficulty.</p>
      <p n="98">In the matter of damages arising from the non-performance or improper performance of the services involved in the package, the Member States may allow compensation to be limited in accordance with the international conventions governing such services.</p>
      <p n="99">In the matter of damage other than personal injury resulting from the non-performance or improper performance of the services involved in the package, the Member States may allow compensation to be limited under the contract. Such limitation shall not be unreasonable.</p>
      <p n="100">3. Without prejudice to the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 2, there may be no exclusion by means of a contractual clause from the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2.</p>
      <p n="101">4. The consumer must communicate any failure in the performance of a contract which he perceives on the spot to the supplier of the services concerned and to the organizer and/or retailer in writing or any other appropriate form at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p n="102">This obligation must be stated clearly and explicily in the contract. Article 6</p>
      <p n="103">In cases of complaint, the organizer and/or retailer or his local representative, if there is one, must make prompt efforts to find appropriate solutions.</p>
      <p n="104">Article 7</p>
      <p n="105">The organizer and/or retailer party to the contract shall provide sufficient evidence of security for the refund of money paid over and for the repatriation of the consumer in the event of insolvency.</p>
      <p n="106">Article 8</p>
      <p n="107">Member States may adopt or return more stringent provisions in the field covered by this Directive to protect the consumer.</p>
      <p n="108">Article 9</p>
      <p n="109">1. Member States shall bring into force the measures necessary to comply with this Directive before 31 December 1992. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="110">2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof.</p>
      <p n="111">Article 10</p>
      <p n="112">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
