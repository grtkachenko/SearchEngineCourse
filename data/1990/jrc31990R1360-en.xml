      <p n="11">Whereas the European Council meeting at Strasbourg on 8 and 9 December 1989 called upon the Council to adopt, at the beginning of 1990, the necessary decisions for the establishment of a European Training Foundation for Central and Eastern Europe, acting on a proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas on 18 December 1989 the Council adopted Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 (4) on economic aid to the Republic of Hungary and the Polish People's Republic which provides for aid in areas including training to support the process of economic and social reform in Hungary and Poland;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the Council may subsequently extend such aid to other countries of Central and Eastern Europe under a relevant legal act;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the process of economic and social reform will contribute to the development of mutually beneficial economic and commercial relationships between the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Community; whereas these intensified relationships will also contribute to a harmonious development of economic activities within the Community;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the European Training Foundation could make an important contribution to the effective provision of training assistance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe eligible for economic aid to support the process of reform;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas, for its contribution, the European Training Foundation will need to call upon the experience gained within the Community in the area of vocational training in implementing a common policy for vocational training and upon its institutions concerned with training;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas there exist in the Community and in third countries, including the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, regional and/or national, public and/or private facilities which can be called upon to collaborate in the effective provision of aid in the area of training;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas the status and structure of the European Training Foundation should facilitate a flexible response to the specific and differing requirements of the individual countries to be assisted, and allow it to carry out its functions in close cooperation with the existing national and international facilities;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas the European Training Foundation should be endowed with legal personality, while maintaining a close corporate relationship with the Commission and respecting the overall political responsibilities of the Community and its institutions;</p>

      <p n="21">Whereas the European Training Foundation should be open to the participation of countries which are not members of the Community and which share the commitment of the Community and the Member States to the provision of aid to Central and Eastern Europe in the training field under arrangements to be laid down in agreements between the Community and themselves;</p>
