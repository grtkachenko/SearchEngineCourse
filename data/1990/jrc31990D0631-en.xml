      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 354/83 of 1 February 1983 concerning the opening to the public of the historical archives of the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,</p>

      <p n="6">Whereas, under the rules governing the opening to the public of the historical archives of the Communities, documents and records covered by the obligation of professional or business secrecy may not be released to the public unless the person or undertaking concerned does not object ; whereas, to this effect, the Commission must give notice of its intention to release the documents and records to the public;</p>
