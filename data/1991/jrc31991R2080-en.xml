      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1056/91 (2), and in particular Article 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 950/68 of 28 June 1968 on the Common Customs Tariff (3), repealed by Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, established the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff on the basis of the Convention of 15 December 1950 on nomenclature for the classification of goods in customs tariffs;</p>

      <p n="8">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 established a goods nomenclature called the combined nomenclature, which simultaneously meets the requirements of the Common Customs Tariff and of the external trade statistics of the Community, and is based on the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, replacing the Convention of 25 December 1950;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 lays down that the codes and descriptions of goods established on the basis of the combined nomenclature are to replace those established on the basis of the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff in force on 31 December 1987;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas those Regulations which are still of practical significance and whose transposition will involve no changes of substance should be amended accordingly and so to complement an initial series of Regulations which has been adopted by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 646/89 (5) and Regulation (EEC) No 2723/90 (6),</p>
      <p n="11">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="13">In the Regulations listed in column 1 of the Annex, which refer to the goods described in column 2, the codes based on the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff in column 3 shall be replaced by the codes based on the combined nomenclature listed in column 4.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
