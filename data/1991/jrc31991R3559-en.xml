      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3559/91 of 6 December 1991 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2670/81 laying down detailed implementing rules in respect of sugar production in excess of the quota</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3559/91 of 6 December 1991 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2670/81 laying down detailed implementing rules in respect of sugar production in excess of the quota</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 464/91 (2), and in particular Article 26 (3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Article 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that C sugar and C isoglucose may not be disposed of on the Community's internal market and must be exported in the natural state before 1 January following the end of the marketing year in question; whereas that Article also provides for an amount to be levied on C sugar and C isoglucose which has not been proved at a date to be determined to have been exported in the natural state within the time limit laid down;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, however, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2670/81 of 14 September 1981 laying down detailed implementing rules in respect of sugar production in excess of the quota (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 56/91 (4), provides that manufacturers of C sugar or of C isoglucose established in the territory of a Member State may on export replace their C sugar by another white sugar in the natural state or replace their C isoglucose by another isoglucose produced by another manufacturer established in the territory of the same Member State provided that the manufacturer making the replacement pays a flat-rate amount of ECU 1,25 per 100 kilograms of white sugar or per 100 kilograms of dry matter;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the payment of that amount is intended to offset any advantage which may arise from such replacement, in particular from the viewpoint of transport costs; whereas the abovementioned flat-rate amount was established several years ago and since then transport conditions and methods have developed considerably, thus making carriage less expensive; whereas it also appears that as a result manufacturers no longer tend to make use of this possibility of replacement; whereas that flat-rate amount should therefore be adjusted to an extent which does not encourage replacement;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the amount to be collected when C sugar or C isoglucose is not exported within the time limit laid down is also determined by taking into account a flat-rate amount representing the supposed economic benefit relating in particular to transport costs; whereas that flat-rate amount should also be adjusted by the same amount;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, in order to prevent a different flat-rate amount being applied to C sugar or C isoglucose produced during one and the same marketing year, provision should be made for the new flat-rate amount to apply only from the time of production of C sugar or C isoglucose from the 1991/92 marketing year;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">Regulation (EEC) No 2670/81 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="15">1. In the second subparagraph of Article 2 (2), '1,25 ECU' is replaced by 'ECU 1,00'.</p>
      <p n="16">2. In Article 3 (1) (a) and (b), '1,25 ECU' is replaced by 'ECU 1,00'.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="19">It shall apply to the C sugar and C isoglucose produced from the 1991/92 marketing year onwards. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="20">Done at Brussels, 6 December 1991. For the Commission</p>
