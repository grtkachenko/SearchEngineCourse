      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas some Community Directives relating to the environment require the Member States to establish a report on the measures taken to implement them; whereas the Commission drafts a consolidated report; whereas other Community Directives relating to the environment call for no such reports;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the existing provisions on the establishment of reports stipulate different intervals between reports and set different requirements for their content;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas such an obligation should be introduced to enable the Member States and the Commission alike to assess the progress made in implementing these Directives throughout the Community's territory and, at the same time, to provide the general public with a source of information on this subject;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the existing provisions should therefore be harmonized to make them more consistent and more complete on a sectoral basis;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the interval at which the Member States submit these reports to the Commission should be fixed at three years, with a one-year interval between sectors; whereas the reports are to be drawn up on the basis of a questionnaire produced by the Commission with the assistance of a committee and sent to Member States six months before the start of the period referred to by the report; whereas the Commission is to publish a consolidated report on the sector concerned within nine months of Member States' submission of their respective reports;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, in particular, the report on the implementation of Council Directive 76/160/EEC of 8 December 1975 concerning the quality of bathing water (4), as last amended by the 1985 Act of Accession, should appear annually and in sufficient time to inform the public of the quality of bathing water for the most recent period.</p>
