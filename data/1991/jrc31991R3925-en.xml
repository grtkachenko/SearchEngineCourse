      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) NÂ° 3925/91</p>
      <p n="3">of 19 December 1991</p>
      <p n="4">concerning the elimination of controls and formalities applicable to the cabin and hold baggage of persons taking an intra-Community flight and the baggage of persons making an intra-Community sea crossing</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,</p>

      <p n="8">In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Article 8a of the Treaty provides that the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement, in particular, of goods is ensured; whereas in this context ports and airports stand apart as either may constitute, at the same time, an external frontier and an internal border; whereas the application of the principle of freedom of movement should nevertheless result in the elimination of controls on the cabin and hold baggage of persons taking an intra-Community flight and the baggage of persons making an intra-Community sea crossing;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas a journey by air may involve several successive legs some being within Community territory and others outside it; whereas the treatment of some flights must take into account the practicalities of organizing controls and of international competition; whereas specific provision should be made to cover such special cases;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas maritime transport may involve different types of voyage; whereas specific provision should be made to cover certain special cases of maritime transport;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas such specific provisions must be applied without prejudice to safety and security checks,</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas Member States must, however, be free to take specific measures compatible with Community law for the purpose of carrying out special controls, inter alia, in order to prevent criminal activities linked in particular to terrorism, drugs and the traffic in works of art,</p>
