      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) N° 3922/91 of 16 December 1991 on the harmonization of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 84 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, as provided for in Article 8a of the Treaty, measures should be adopted with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992; whereas the internal market will comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas a high general level of safety in civil aviation in Europe should be maintained and current technical requirements and administrative procedures in the Member States should be raised to the highest standard currently attained in the Community;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas safety is a key factor in Community air transport; whereas account should be taken of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed in Chicago on 7 December 1944, which provides for implementation of the measures necessary to ensure the safe operation of aircraft;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the current restrictions on the transfer of aircraft and aviation products and of certain services in the field of aviation between Member States would cause distortions in the internal market;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA), an associated body of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), have worked out arrangements to cooperate in the development and implementation of joint aviation requirements (JARs) in all fields relating to the safety of aircraft and their operation;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, under the common transport policy, technical requirements and administrative procedures relating to the safety of aircraft and their operation should be harmonized on the basis of the JAR codes of the JAA;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the accession of all Member States to the JAA and the participation of the Commission in its proceedings would facilitate such harmonization;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas, in order to achieve the Community objectives as regards freedom of movement of persons and products and also as regards the common transport policy, Member States should accept the certification of products and of bodies and persons concerned with the design, manufacture, maintenance and operation of products, without further technical work or evaluation, when the product, organization or person has been certificated in accordance with the common technical requirements and administrative procedures;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas safety problems may arise and, in such case, Member States must take all appropriate measures as a matter of urgency; whereas such measures must be duly justified and, where the common technical requirements and administrative procedures present shortcomings, it is for the Commission, exercising its implementing powers, to adopt the necessary amendments;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas it is desirable that funding by the Member States of research to improve aviation safety be coordinated to ensure optimum use of resources and to enable the maximum benefit to be achieved;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas it is appropriate to empower the Commission, assisted by a committee of experts nominated by the Member States, to make the amendments devoloped by the JAA to the common technical requirements and administrative procedures adopted by the Council,</p>
      <p n="19">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="20">Article 1</p>

      <p n="22">- the design, manufacture, operation and maintenance of aircraft,</p>
      <p n="23">- persons and organizations involved in these tasks.</p>
      <p n="24">2. The harmonized technical requirements and administrative procedures referred to in paragraph 1 shall apply to all aircraft operated by operators as defined in Article 2 (a), whether registered in a Member State or in a third country.</p>

      <p n="29">(c) 'appliance` means any instrument, equipment, mechanism, apparatus or accessory used or intended to be used in operating an aircraft in flight, whether installed in, intended to be installed in, or attached to, a civil aircraft, but not forming part of an airframe, engine or propeller;</p>
      <p n="30">(d) 'component` means a material, part or sub-assembly not covered by the definitions in (b) or (c) for use on civil aircraft, engines, propellers or appliances;</p>
      <p n="31">(e) 'certification` (of a product, service, organization or person) means any form of legal recognition that such a product, service, body or person complies with the applicable requirements. Such certification comprises two acts:</p>
      <p n="32">(i) the act of checking that technically the product, service, organization or person complies with the applicable requirements; this act is referred to as 'making the technical findings`;</p>
      <p n="33">(ii) the act of formal recognition of such compliance with the applicable requirements by the issue of a certificate, licence, approval or other document in the manner required by national laws and procedures; this act is referred to as 'making the legal findings`;</p>
      <p n="34">(f) 'maintenance` means all inspections, servicing, modification and repair throughout the life of an aircraft needed to ensure that the aircraft remains in compliance with the type certification and offers a high level of safety in all circumstances; this shall include in particular modifications imposed by the authorities party to the arrangements referred to in (h) in accordance with airworthiness checking concepts;</p>

      <p n="47">Article 7</p>
      <p n="48">Member States shall recognize the certification granted pursuant to this Regulation by another Member State or by a body acting on its behalf, to bodies or persons placed under its jurisdiction and under its authority, who are concerned with the design, manufacture and maintenance of products, and the operation of aircraft.</p>
      <p n="49">Article 8</p>
      <p n="50">1. None of the above provisions shall prevent a Member State from reacting immediately to a safety problem which becomes apparent from an accident, incident or service experience and involves either a product designed, manufactured, operated or maintained in accordance with this Regulation, or a person, procedure or body involved in such tasks. If the safety problem results from:</p>
      <p n="51">- an inadequate safety level corresponding to the application of the common technical requirements and administrative procedures, or - shortcomings in the common technical requirements and administrative procedures,</p>
      <p n="52">the Member State shall forthwith inform the Commission and the other Member States of the measures taken and the reasons therefor.</p>
      <p n="53">2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall consult the Member States at the earliest opportunity.
