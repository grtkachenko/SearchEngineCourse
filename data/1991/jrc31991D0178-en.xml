      <p n="66">Budget contributions</p>
      <p n="67">15. (a) Each member shall contribute to an annual budget approved by the Group.

For this purpose, countries whose production of tin-in-concentrates exceeds their reported consumption of primary tin metal shall be classified as producing countries, and countries whose reported consumption of primary tin metal exceeds their production of tin-in-concentrates shall be classified as consuming countries. The calculation shall be on the basis of the latest three calendar years for which statistics are available.</p>
      <p n="68">(b) The Group shall determine the contribution of each member for each financial year in a single currency to be decided by the Group and in accordance with the provisions for contributions specified in the rules of procedure.

      <p n="72">(c) The Group shall endeavour to ensure that no information published by it shall prejudice the confidentiality of the operations of governments or of persons or enterprises producing, processing, marketing or consuming tin.</p>
      <p n="73">Annual assessment and reports</p>
      <p n="74">17. (a) The Group shall undertake an annual assessment of the world tin situation and related matters in the light of information supplied by members and supplemented by information from all other relevant sources.

      <p n="75">(b) The Group shall prepare a report incorporating the results of the annual assessment and distribute it to members. If the Group deems it appropriate, this report, as well as other reports and studies distributed to members, may be made available to other interested parties in accordance with the rules of procedure.</p>

      <p n="83">Entry into force</p>
      <p n="84">21.

      <p n="92">(d) The Secretary-General of the Group shall promptly notify each member of any notification received under this paragraph.</p>
