      <p n="7">Whereas it has become clear in the light of experience that changes are needed in the structure and operation of the existing Advisory Committee to enable it to concentrate more effectively on those aspects of the Community's customs and taxation policy which the Commission and the Committee itself wish to develop in detail;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas an Advisory Committee on Customs and Indirect Taxation should be set up, with a remit reflecting these new concerns;</p>
