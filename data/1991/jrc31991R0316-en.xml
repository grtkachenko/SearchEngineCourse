      <p n="17">Description of goods Classification CN code Reasons (1) (2) (3) 1. Grated cheese which as a result of its high moisture content and conditions of transport or packaging (partially vacuum packed) becomes agglomerated 0406 20 90 Classification is determined by the provisions of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature and by the wording of CN codes 0406, 0406 20 and 0406 20 90. 2.
