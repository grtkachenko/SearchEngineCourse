      <p n="2">COMMISSION DECISION of 23 July 1997 setting up Scientific Committees in the field of consumer health and food safety (Text with EEA relevance) (97/579/EC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Whereas sound scientific advice is an essential basis for Community rules on consumer health, which concerns matters relating to consumer health in its strictest sense, but also on animal health and welfare, plant health and environmental health;</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas scientific advice on matters relating to consumer health must, in the interests of consumers and industry, be based on the principles of excellence, independence and transparency;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, besides cases in which consultation of the Scientific Committees is mandatory, those Committees may also be consulted on matters of particular relevance to consumer health and food safety;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, although many of the problems requiring a scientific opinion fall within the field of competence of one of the existing Scientific Committees, it is nonetheless apparent that some problems may involve the competence of several Committees;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in order to strengthen their cohesion and at the same time avoid certain overlaps, it is appropriate to redefine the activities of certain Committees;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas by Decision 97/404/EC (1) the Commission established a Scientific Steering Committee to coordinate the work of the Scientific Committees;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the Commission must be able to obtain sound and timely scientific advice;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas several Council directives and a number of Council regulations provide for mandatory consultation of one or another of the current Scientific Committees; whereas the Commission intends to make appropriate proposals to the Council to adapt existing legislation to this Decision,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">1. The following Scientific Committees are hereby established within the Commission:</p>
      <p n="16">- Scientific Committee on Food,</p>
      <p n="17">- Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition,</p>
      <p n="18">- Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare,</p>
      <p n="19">- Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health,</p>
      <p n="20">- Scientific Committee on Plants,</p>
      <p n="21">- Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers,</p>
      <p n="22">- Scientific Committee on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices,</p>
      <p n="23">- Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment.</p>
      <p n="24">2. The fields of competence of the Scientific Committees shall be as set out in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="25">3. The Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare shall be composed of a sub-committee on Animal Health and a sub-committee on Animal Welfare.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 2</p>
      <p n="27">1. The Scientific Committees shall be consulted in the cases laid down by Community legislation. The Commission may also decide to consult them on other questions of particular relevance to consumer health and food safety.</p>
      <p n="28">2. When the question submitted is common to several of the Scientific Committees mentioned in Article 1, and following identification by the Scientific Steering Committee of the Committees involved, they may set up a common working group to prepare their respective opinions. The creation of such a group shall be obligatory if the Scientific Steering Committee so requests.</p>
      <p n="29">3. At the Commission's request, the Scientific Committees shall provide scientific advice on matters relating to consumer health and food safety. In particular, they shall:</p>
      <p n="30">(a) critically examine risk assessments made by scientists belonging to Member States' organizations;</p>

      <p n="32">(c) draft scientific opinions designed to enable the Commission to evaluate the scientific basis of the recommendations, standards and guidelines prepared in international forums;</p>
      <p n="33">(d) evaluate the scientific principles on which Community health standards are based, taking into account the risk-assessment techniques developed by the international organizations concerned.</p>
      <p n="34">4. On the basis of trends in existing scientific data, the Scientific Committees may draw the Commission's attention to any specific or emerging problem falling within their remit in matters of consumer health and food safety.</p>
      <p n="35">5. The Commission may require the adoption of an opinion within a specified period.</p>
      <p n="36">Article 3</p>
      <p n="37">1. Each Scientific Committee shall consist of a maximum of 19 members. The number of members of each Committee shall be determined by the Commission in accordance with the requisite expertise.</p>

      <p n="39">3. The members of the Scientific Committee shall be appointed by the Commission, following publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities of a call for expressions of interest, together with the selection criteria and a description of the selection procedure. The selection procedure shall identify, in a transparent manner, the most suitable applicants for appointment to the Committees.

      <p n="44">2. Where a member of a Scientific Committee is unable to carry out his duties or in the event of his/her voluntary resignation, the Commission shall nominate an appropriate replacement for the remaining term of office, drawn from the list of suitable candidates under Article 3 (3).</p>
      <p n="45">3. Members of the Scientific Committees and the external experts shall be remunerated for the services they provide to the Commission, in addition to the reimbursement of travel and subsistence allowances in accordance with the rules laid down by the Commission.</p>
      <p n="46">Article 6</p>
      <p n="47">1. Members of the Scientific Committees, in their capacity as such, shall act independently of all external influence.</p>

      <p n="49">3. Members of the Scientific Committees and the external experts shall declare at each meeting any specific interests which might be considered prejudicial to their independence.</p>
      <p n="50">Article 7</p>
      <p n="51">1. In agreement with the Commission, the Scientific Committees and the sub-committees may invite specialized external experts to participate in their work.</p>
      <p n="52">2. The Scientific Committees and the sub-committes may create specific working parties with clearly defined tasks. Each working party shall be chaired by a member of the Committee or of the sub-committee and may include external experts.</p>
      <p n="53">3. The working parties shall report to the Scientific Committee or sub-committee to which they are attached.</p>
      <p n="54">Article 8</p>
      <p n="55">1. The Scientific Committees shall adopt harmonized rules of procedure in collaboration with the Scientific Steering Committee. These rules of procedure shall ensure that the Scientific Committees perform their tasks in the best possible way, in compliance with the principles of excellence, independence and transparency, whilst having regard to legitime requests for commercial confidentiality. They shall be made public.</p>
      <p n="56">2. Specifically, for each Scientific Committee, the rules must lay down procedures with a view to:</p>
      <p n="57">(a) appointing rapporteurs to assemble information packages and documentation and prepare draft opinions for the Scientific Committee;</p>
      <p n="58">(b) verifying that the rapporteurs are in a position to perform their assignments as independently as possible, free of outside influence;</p>
      <p n="59">(c) delivering an opinion as quickly as possible, and in any event within the time-limit fixed pursuant to Article 2 (5);</p>
      <p n="60">(d) ensuring close collaboration with the other Scientific Committees and the Scientific Steering Committee.</p>
      <p n="61">3. The Scientific Committees shall adopt their opinions by a majority of the members which make up the Committee.</p>
      <p n="62">4. The sub-committees shall adopt draft opinions by a majority of the members which make up the sub-committee, which shall subsequently be submitted to the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare for final adoption.</p>
