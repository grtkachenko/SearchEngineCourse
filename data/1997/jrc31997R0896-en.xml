      <p n="14">Amounts that, in accordance with accounts clearance decisions as referred to in the first subparagraph, are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State shall be determined by deducting advances paid during the financial year in question from expenditure recognized for that year in accordance with the first subparagraph. Such amounts shall be deducted from, or added to, advances against expenditure from the second month following that in which the accounts clearance decision is taken.</p>
