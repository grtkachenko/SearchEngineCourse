      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC (1), as last amended by Commission Decision 96/405/EC (2), and in particular the first indent of Chapter 2 of Annex II,</p>

      <p n="7">Whereas Chapter III of Directive 92/118/EEC lays down general provisions applying to imports into the Community; whereas specific public health requirements should be laid down for egg product imports; whereas these must be at least as stringent as those in force for placing on the market;</p>

      <p n="9">Whereas, in addition, where it is possible to recognize conditions offering equivalent guarantees, a third country may submit a proposal for such recognition to the Commission for appropriate consideration;</p>
