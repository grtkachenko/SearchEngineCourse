      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 936/97 of 27 May 1997 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for high-quality fresh, chilled and frozen beef and for frozen buffalo meat</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV.6 negotiations (1), and in particular Article 1 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas the Community has undertaken, pursuant to the Agreement on agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, to open tariff quotas for high-quality beef and frozen buffalo meat, fixed at an annual quantity of 58 100 tonnes and 2 250 tonnes respectively; whereas those quotas should be opened on a multiannual basis and detailed rules should be adopted for their application for 12-month periods starting on 1 July;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the exporting third countries have undertaken to issue certificates of authenticity guaranteeing the origin of the products; whereas the form and layout of the certificates and the procedures for using them must be specified; whereas certificates of authenticity must be issued by authorities in third countries affording all the necessary guarantees to ensure that the arrangements concerned are properly applied;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the quota in question should be managed using import licences; whereas to this end rules should be laid down on submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, by way of derogation, if necessary, from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2350/96 (3), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 266/97 (5);</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in order to ensure proper management of the imports of meat, provision should be made, where relevant, for import licences to be issued subject to verification, in particular of entries on certificates of authenticity;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas experience has shown that importers do not always inform the competent authorities which issued the import licences of the quantity and origin of the beef imported under the quota in question; whereas this information is important for the assessment of the market situation; whereas a security should therefore be introduced to ensure that importers comply with this requirement;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas provision should be made for the Member States to forward information concerning such imports;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
