      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 92/75/EEC of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources of household appliances (1), and in particular Articles 9 and 12 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas electricity by use dishwashers accounts for a significant part of total Community energy demand; whereas the scope for reduced energy use by these appliances is substantial;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas a better cleaning or drying performance often requires a higher consumption of water and energy; whereas information on the cleaning or drying performance of an appliance is helpful in evaluating the information on its energy and water consumption; whereas this will help consumers make a choice of appliance which is consistent with the rational use of energy;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the Community, confirming its interest in an international standardization system capable of producing standards that are actually used by all partners in international trade and of meeting the requirements of Community policy, invites the European standards organizations to continue their cooperation with international standards organizations;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (Cenelec) are the bodies recognized as competent to adopt harmonized standards in accordance with the general guidelines for cooperation between the Commission and these two bodies signed on 13 November 1984; whereas within the meaning of this Directive, a harmonized standard is a technical specification (European standard or harmonization document) adopted by Cenelec, on the basis of a remit (mandate) from the Commission in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 83/189/EEC of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (2), as last amended by Commission Decision 96/139/EC (3), and on the basis of those general guidelines;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the measures set out in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the committee set up under Article 10 of Directive 92/75/EEC,</p>

Throughout this Directive any provisions requiring the giving of information relating to noise shall apply only where that information is required under Article 3 of Council Directive 86/594/EEC (4). Such information, where required, shall be measured in accordance with that Directive.</p>
      <p n="15">3. The harmonized standards referred to in paragraph 2 shall be drawn up under mandate from the Commission in accordance with Directive 83/189/EEC.</p>
      <p n="16">4. In this Directive, except where the context otherwise requires, the expressions used have the same meaning as in Directive 92/75/EEC.</p>
