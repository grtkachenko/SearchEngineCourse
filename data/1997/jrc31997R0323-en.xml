      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 323/97 of 21 February 1997 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2406/96 laying down common marketing standards for certain fishery products</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 of 17 December 1992 on the common organization of the market in fishery and aquaculture products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3318/94 (2), and in particular Article 2 (4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 2406/96 (3) introduces in particular a new scale of size categories for herring of the species Clupea harengus; whereas in the case of Baltic herring this new scale establishes a specific size for products taken and landed north of 59° 30' but does not include that previously applicable in the whole of the Baltic;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas this omission fails to take account of the production and sales conditions of herring taken in the Baltic, south of 59° 30'; whereas steps should be taken therefore to establish the appropriate size category for this product again by amending Regulation (EC) No 2406/96 accordingly;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas this amendment will constitute a technical adjustment to the common marketing standards as provided for in Article 2 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">In Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2406/96, the scale of size categories applicable to Baltic herring (Clupea harengus) is hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="15">It shall apply from 1 January 1997.</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="17">Done at Brussels, 21 February 1997.</p>
