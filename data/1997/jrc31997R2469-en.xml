      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2469/97 of 11 December 1997 amending Regulations (EEC) No 1964/82 laying down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of boned meat of bovine animals, (EEC) No 3846/87 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds and (EC) No 1445/95 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2321/97 (2), and in particular Article 13 (12) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3169/87 (4), lays down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of boned meat from hindquarters of adult male cattle;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, following implementation of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, arrangements should be introduced to permit better targeting of beef and veal products to which preference is to be given for export to third countries; whereas the introduction of a special refund for boned cuts from forequarters of adult male cattle would meet that objective; whereas the arrangements provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82 should therefore be extended to those products;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the minimum lean meat content applies to the average of all the boned cuts; whereas that minimum content should therefore be set at 55 %;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas experience has shown that certain technical amendments are required, inter alia the maximum number of ribs in the hindquarter should be reduced from nine to eight and operators should be allowed to market the fillet from those hindquarters in the Community;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the derogations provided for in Article 7 (1) are no longer granted by the Member States; whereas they should therefore be deleted;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, since the implementation of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, the Commission may monitor, by means of export licences, the quantities for which a special refund is granted; whereas the communications by the Member States referred to in Article 9 may therefore be abolished;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas Commission Regulations (EEC) No 798/80 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 471/87 (6), and (EEC) No 2730/79 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1180/97 (8), were repealed by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3665/87 of 27 November 1987 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 815/97 (10); whereas the references should be updated by this Regulation;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the introduction of a special refund for boned cuts from forequarters of adult male cattle involves an amendment of the refund nomenclature and the categories of beef and veal eligible for a refund; whereas Sector 5 of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (11), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2333/97 (12), and Annex III to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 (13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2284/97 (14), should therefore be replaced;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
