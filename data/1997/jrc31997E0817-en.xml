      <p n="6">Whereas it is appropriate to update and further develop the initiatives carried out by the European Union under Joint Action 96/588/CFSP adopted by the Council on the basis of Article J.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on anti-personnel landmines (1); whereas that Joint Action was adopted in the light of the outcome of the Review Conference on the Convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects, hereinafter referred to as 'the 1980 Convention`;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the Council Resolution of 22 November 1996 on the fight against anti-personnel landmines identified certain measures which could be adopted and the criteria which should govern the allocation of funds for mine-clearing projects;</p>
