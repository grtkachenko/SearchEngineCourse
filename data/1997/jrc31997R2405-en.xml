      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2405/97 of 3 December 1997 amending Regulation (EC) No 2125/95 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for preserved mushrooms of the genus Agaricus spp.</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organization of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products (1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2199/97 (2), and in particular Article 15 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 of 22 December 1995 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements to take account of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1595/97 (4), and in particular Article 8 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2125/95 (5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2723/95 (6), provides for the quotas to be distributed between traditional importers and new importers and defines both categories of importers; whereas experience from several years of applying the scheme shows that the criteria for eligibility should be made more rigorous in order to restrict applications to undertakings which import and export processed fruit and vegetables; whereas there should also be a transitional period before this new provision is applied to traditional importers;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2125/95 should be amended to adjust the quotas of preserved mushrooms allocated to Bulgaria, Poland and Romania in the light of the new quantities indicated in Annexes VI, II and V, respectively, to Regulation (EC) No 3066/95; whereas, however, these quotas must continue to be administered by calendar year and not by periods from 1 July to 30 June, in order to maintain traditional import schedules, taking into account the fact that for the other third countries the quantities allocated for 1997 have been used up since 2 January 1997, as indicated in Commission Regulation (EC) No 8/97 (7);</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas products falling within CN code 0711 90 60, covering certain preserves of mushrooms not of the genus Agaricus, have been added to the Polish quota for preserved mushrooms of the genus Agaricus in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 3066/95; whereas Regulation (EC) No 2125/95 should be amended so that these products can also be imported at the preferential tariff rate;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Decision No 1/97 of the Association Council, association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republics of Bulgaria (8), Poland (9) and Romania (10), of the other part, amends Protocol 4 to the Europe Agreements with Bulgaria (11), Poland (12) and Romania (13) with effect respectively from 1 January, 1 July and 31 January 1997; whereas the proof of origin of the imported products should be amended accordingly;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas certain lapsed transitional provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2125/95 should be deleted;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
