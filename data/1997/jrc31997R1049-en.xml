      <p n="17">(ii) every 10th haul should be sampled in detail by species, providing in addition to weights of the sample measured also numbers at length representing the part of the catch to be landed and the part of the catch discarded;</p>
      <p n="18">(iii) whenever the fishing site is changed by a distance of more than 5 nm the cycle described in (i) and (ii) starts again.`</p>
      <p n="19">2. The last sentence of point 3 (i) shall be replaced by the following:</p>
