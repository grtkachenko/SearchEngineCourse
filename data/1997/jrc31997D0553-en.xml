      <p n="7">Whereas these measures include an opportunity for products which have been despatched to the Community before the entry into force of these requirements and presented for importation into the Community before 15 August 1997, to gain entry to the Community on condition that they are systematically submitted to a microbiological examination upon arrival;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas it is necessary to extend this delay, whilst ensuring a high level of consumer protection;</p>
