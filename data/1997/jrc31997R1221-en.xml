      <p n="12">Whereas, given these circumstances and in order to improve the production and marketing of honey in the Community, national programmes should be established without delay for each year comprising technical assistance, measures to control varroasis and related diseases, a rationalization of transhumance, the management of regional beekeeping centres and cooperation on research programmes to improve the quality of honey;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, in order to supplement the statistical data on the agricultural sector, Member States should carry out studies on the structure of the sector, covering production, marketing and price formation;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas expenditure by the Member States in fulfilment of the obligations arising from this Regulation should be borne by the Community pursuant to Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (4);</p>
