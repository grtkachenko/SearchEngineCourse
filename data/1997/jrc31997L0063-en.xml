      <p n="7">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Article G of the Treaty on European Union replaced the term 'European Economic Community` by the term 'European Community`; whereas the initials 'EEC` should therefore be replaced by the initials 'EC`;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the term 'EEC fertilizer` is contained in certain provisions of Council Directive 76/116/EEC of 18 December 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to fertilizers (4), Council Directive 80/876/EEC of 15 July 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to straight ammonium nitrate fertilizers of high nitrogen content (5), Council Directive 89/284/EEC of 13 April 1989 supplementing and amending Directive 76/116/EEC in respect of the calcium, magnesium, sodium and sulphur content of fertilizers (6) and Council Directive 89/530/EEC of 18 September 1989 supplementing and amending Directive 76/116/EEC in respect of the trace elements boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum and zinc contained in fertilizers (7); whereas, in consequence, the term 'EEC fertilizer` should be replaced in these provisions by the term 'EC fertilizer`;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, however, manufacturers normally keep in stock large quantities of packagings, labels and accompanying documents, thereby exposing themselves to the risk of incurring additional expenditure in the event of such a change being implemented with immediate effect; whereas, therefore, a period should be fixed during which packagings, labels and accompanying documents marked 'EEC fertilizer` can continue to be used,</p>
