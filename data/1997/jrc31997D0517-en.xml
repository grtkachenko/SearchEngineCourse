      <p n="6">Whereas Community inspections in Madagascar have shown that there are serious deficiencies with regard to infrastructure and hygiene in meat establishments and that there are not enough guarantees of the efficiency of the controls carried out by the competent authorities; whereas animal health management in Madagascar shows severe deficiencies and non-application of Community rules; whereas there is a potential risk for public health with regard to the production and processing of animal products, excluding fishery products, in this country;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas imports of products of animal origin, excluding fishery products, from Madagascar must not be allowed until it can be guaranteed that no more risk exists;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas this Decision will be reviewed before 30 November 1997;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in conformity with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>

      <p n="14">Without prejudice to Commission Decision 97/516/EC (3), Member States shall prohibit imports of products of animal origin.</p>
      <p n="15">However, consignments which left Madagascar prior to the entry into force of this Decision, and which are presented at the Community inspection post for importation before 15 August 1997, shall be submitted to a re-inforced physical examination and if appropriate, a microbiological examination for the detection, in particular, of Bacillus anthracis and Clostridium chauvoei.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 3</p>
      <p n="17">This Decision will be reviewed before 30 November 1997.</p>
