      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EC) No 1087/97 of 9 June 1997 authorizing imports into the Canary Islands of textile and clothing products and certain quota products originating in China without quantitative restrictions or measures with an equivalent effect</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1087/97 of 9 June 1997 authorizing imports into the Canary Islands of textile and clothing products and certain quota products originating in China without quantitative restrictions or measures with an equivalent effect</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, according to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 of 26 June 1991 on the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands (1), the Council may allow derogations, at the request of the Spanish authorities, from the provisions of the common commercial policy applicable to the territory of the Canary Islands;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Spain has asked for such derogations and requests that quantitative restrictions applicable in the Community to imports of textile and clothing products and certain quota products originating in China be waived in respect of products intended for consumption in the Canary Islands;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, in the light of the special constraints facing the Canary Islands, the free trade arrangements in force at the time of Spain's accession to the Community and the low volume of trade involved, such a derogation would appear justifiable;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas provisions should be adopted to ensure that products subject to derogation from the quantitative restrictions in force are exclusively for the internal market of the Canary Islands and that the Commission receives regular reports on the volume of imports and reconsignments;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, if the products in question are consigned to the rest of the Community customs territory, measures concerning quantitative restrictions must apply; whereas goods should therefore be accompanied by T5 documents as far as the customs office where they are released for consumption on presentation of the corresponding documents in order to ensure that they are subject to these measures,</p>
      <p n="11">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="12">Article 1</p>
      <p n="13">Textile products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Combined Nomenclature and those included in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports from certain third countries and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1765/82, (EEC) No 1766/82 and (EEC) No 3420/83 (2) shall be released for import into the Canary Islands without quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect.</p>

      <p n="17">Article 3</p>
      <p n="18">1.
