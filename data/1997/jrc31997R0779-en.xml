      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 779/97 of 24 April 1997 introducing arrangements for the management of fishing effort in the Baltic Sea</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, under the terms of the 1994 Act of Accession, transitional arrangements governing access to waters are to apply until the Community system of special fishing permits is introduced; whereas these arrangements are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 3237/94 (4);</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas these arrangements imply that Community measures will be adopted laying down the conditions of access to waters and resources and for the pursuit of fishing activities and introducing the Community system of special fishing permits; whereas this Regulation establishes such measures;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas data need to be collected on the fishing effort deployed by Community vessels in the fisheries to which the arrangements apply, in order to obtain a clearer understanding of the exploitation of those fisheries;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas it is the responsibility of the flag Member State to introduce arrangements for monitoring fishing effort; whereas it is necessary therefore to ensure the transparency and fairness of the management and control procedures;</p>

      <p n="27">Where necessary, the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92, may set levels for fishing effort taking into account in particular the condition of stocks in the fisheries referred to in the Annex hereto.</p>
      <p n="28">Article 6</p>

      <p n="31">Article 7</p>
      <p n="32">1. This Regulation shall apply to vessels of more that 15 metres between perpendiculars or more than 18 metres overall.</p>
      <p n="33">2. The fishing effort of vessels below that limit shall be assessed globally for each fishery.</p>
