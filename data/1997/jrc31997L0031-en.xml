      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 97/31/EC of 11 June 1997 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 76/760/EEC relating to the rear registration plate lamps for motor vehicles and their trailers (Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), as last amended by European Parliament and Council Directive 96/79/EC (2), and in particular Article 13 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Directive 76/760/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the rear registration plate lamps for motor vehicles and their trailers (3), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Article 10 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Directive 76/760/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EEC type-approval procedure which has been established by Directive 70/156/EEC; whereas, consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, in particular, Articles 3 (4) and 4 (3) of Directive 70/156/EEC require each separate Directive to have attached to it an information document and also a type-approval certificate based on Annex VI to that Directive in order that type-approval may be computerized; whereas the type-approval certificate(s) provided for in Directive 76/760/EEC must be amended accordingly;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the procedures need to be simplified in order to maintain the equivalence established by Article 9 (2) of Directive 70/156/EEC between certain separate Directives and the corresponding regulations of the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe when the said regulations are amended; whereas, as a first step, the technical requirements of Directive 76/760/EEC need to be replaced by those of Regulation No 4 by way of cross-reference;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas reference is made to Council Directive 76/756/EEC (4), as last amended by Commission Directive 97/28/EC (5), and to Directive 76/761/EEC (6), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>

      <p n="17">2. The first paragraph of Article 2 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="18">'Member States shall for each type of rear registration plate lamp which they approve pursuant to Article 1, issue to the manufacturer an EEC component type-approval mark conforming to the model shown in Annex 1, Appendix 3.`</p>
      <p n="19">3. Article 4 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="20">'Article 4</p>
      <p n="21">The competent authorities of the Member States shall inform each other, by means of the procedure specified in Article 4 (6) of Directive 70/156/EEC, of each approval which they have granted, refused or withdrawn pursuant to this Directive.`</p>
      <p n="22">4. Article 9 is replaced by the following:</p>

      <p n="239">1. DEFINITION</p>
      <p n="240">For the purpose of this Regulation</p>
      <p n="241">1.1. 'Rear registration plate lamp` means the device for the illumination of rear registration plates hereinafter called 'illuminating device`, which illuminates the rear registration plate by reflection. For the approval of this device, the illumination of the space to be occupied by the plate is determined.</p>
      <p n="242">1.2. The definitions given in Regulation No 48 and its series of amendments in force at the time of application for type approval shall apply to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="243">5. GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS</p>
      <p n="244">5.1. Each sample shall conform to the lighting specifications of paragraph 9.</p>
      <p n="245">Illuminating devices must be so designed that the entire surface to be illuminated is visible from the rear within the field of vision indicated in the drawing in annex 4.</p>
      <p n="246">5.2. All measurements shall be carried out by adjusting the lamp or lamps of the illuminating device to the minimum light flux prescribed for the test voltage in the specification of the lamp or lamps for the device.</p>
      <p n="247">5.2.1. All measurements on lamps equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other) shall be made at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V respectively.</p>
      <p n="248">In the case of light sources supplied by a special power supply, the above test voltages shall be applied to the input terminals of that power supply. The test laboratory may require from the manufacturer the special power needed to supply the light sources.</p>
      <p n="249">6. COLOUR OF LIGHT</p>
      <p n="250">The light of the lamp used in the illuminating device must be sufficiently colourless not to cause any appreciable change in the colour of the registration plate.</p>
      <p n="251">7. ANGLE OF INCIDENCE</p>
      <p n="252">The manufacturer of the illuminating device shall specify the position in which the device is to be fitted in relation to the space for the registration plate; the device must be so placed that the angle of incidence of the light on the surface of the plate does not exceed 82° at any point on the surface to be illuminated, this angle being measured from the extremity of the device's illuminating area which is furthest from the surface of the plate. If there is more than one illuminating device, the foregoing requirement shall apply only to that part of the plate intended to be illuminated by the device concerned.</p>
      <p n="253">The device must be so designed that no light is emitted directly towards the rear, with the exception of red light if the device is combined or grouped with a rear lamp.</p>
      <p n="254">8. MEASURING PROCEDURE</p>
      <p n="255">Luminance measurements shall be made on a piece of clean white blotting paper with a minimum diffuse reflection factor of 70 per cent, of the same dimensions as the registration plate, placed in the position normally occupied by it and 2 mm in front of its holder.</p>
      <p n="256">Luminance measurements shall be made perpendicularly to the surface of the paper, at the points shown in annex 3 according to the type of plate for which the device is intended, each point representing a circular area 25 mm in diameter.</p>
      <p n="257">9. PHOTOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p n="258">At each of the points of measurement shown in annex 3, the luminance B shall be at least equal to 2.5 cd/m².</p>
      <p n="259">The gradient of the luminance between the values B1 and B2, measured at any two points 1 and 2 selected from among those mentioned above, shall not exceed 2 × Bo/cm, Bo being the minimum luminance measured at the various points, that is to say</p>
      <p n="260">&gt;NUM&gt;B2 - B1 &gt;DEN&gt;distance 1 - 2 in cm &amp;le; 2 × Bo/cm</p>

      <p n="292">when equipped with mass production filament lamps at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, the luminous intensity values produced shall lie between the maximum limit given in this Regulation and the minimum limit of this Regulation increased according to the permissible deviation of the luminous flux permitted for the type of filament lamp chosen, as stated in Regulation No 37 for production filament lamps; alternatively a standard filament lamp may be used in turn, in each of the individual position, operated at its reference flux, the individual measurements in each position being added together.</p>
