      <p n="8">Whereas monitoring of the implementation by Member States of the instruments adopted in this area will reveal the practical effect of the Council's work in this matter and provide useful lessons for its future work,</p>

      <p n="10">Article 1</p>
      <p n="11">Each year, the Presidency shall forward to the Member States a questionnaire designed to show how they have implemented the instruments concerning asylum adopted by the Council and by the Ministers responsible for immigration.</p>
      <p n="12">The questionnaire shall refer to the following matters:</p>
      <p n="13">- provisions, policies and practical measures adopted during the preceding year by the Member States in any of the areas covered by the instruments referred to in the first paragraph,</p>
      <p n="14">- any difficulties encountered in adopting such provisions, policies and practical measures,</p>
      <p n="15">- the likelihood of provisions, policies and practical measures in the areas referred to in the first indent being adopted in the near future,</p>
      <p n="16">- practical application of the aforementioned instruments, provisions, policies and practical measures and any difficulties encountered therewith.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">On the basis of the questionnaire referred to in Article 1, Member States shall prepare an information note in which they may refer to or include relevant parts of their regular submissions to the Centre for Information, Reflection and Exchange on Asylum (CIREA).</p>
      <p n="19">Article 3</p>
      <p n="20">The General Secretariat of the Council shall translate the information notes referred to in Article 2 and make them available to all Member States and to the Commission. It shall also prepare a summary report based on the information notes.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 4</p>
      <p n="22">On the basis of the summary report and any other relevant material, for example from UNHCR and, if appropriate, from non-governmental organizations, the Presidency, in conjunction with the Commission, and after consultation of the UNHCR shall draw up a report which shall contain an analysis suggesting inter alia whether there are issues requiring a further exchange of views between Member States and whether any additional measures are necessary.</p>
      <p n="23">This report shall be examined within the framework of the Council with a view to its submission for consideration by the Council.</p>
      <p n="24">The Presidency will seek the views of the UNHCR on the report and ensure that any comments are communicated to Member States.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 5</p>
