      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, in order to ensure that the common agricultural policy is properly administered, particularly where the pigmeat, the beef and veal and the sheep- and goatmeat markets are concerned, the Commission requires regular data on trends in livestock and in pigmeat, beef and veal and sheep- and goatmeat production;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Council Directive 93/23/EEC of 1 June 1993 on the statistical surveys to be carried out on pig production (3), Council Directive 93/24/EEC of 1 June 1993 on the statistical surveys to be carried out on bovine animal production (4) and Council Directive 93/25/EEC of 1 June 1993 on the statistical surveys to be carried out on sheep and goat stocks (5) regulate the frequency of statistical surveys to be carried out on pig, bovine animal and sheep and goat production;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the reference periods should be adapted in order to achieve better use of the resources available for agricultural statistical surveys;</p>

      <p n="11">Whereas the various statistical surveys in the agricultural sector must be synchronised as far as possible;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas in some Member States the various livestock populations represent a relatively minor part of the Community's total livestock population; whereas therefore these Member States may be granted certain derogations,</p>
