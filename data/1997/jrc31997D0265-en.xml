      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>

      <p n="6">Whereas Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1836/93 establishes that companies implementing national, European or international standards for environmental management systems and audits and certified, according to appropriate certification procedures, as complying with those standards shall be considered as meeting the corresponding requirements of Regulation (EEC) No 1836/93, provided that, in particular, the standards and procedures are recognized by the Commission acting in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 19 of the same Regulation;</p>

      <p n="11">Whereas the use of the specification of the international standard ISO 14001:1996 or the European standard EN ISO 14001:1996 together with their associated guidance may lead to greater degree of correspondence with the requirements of Regulation (EEC) No 1836/93;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the accredited environmental verifier will continue to check compliance with those elements of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1836/93 which are not covered explicitly in the international standard ISO 14001:1996 and the European standard EN ISO 14001:1996, in particular at the document review stage, the accredited environmental verifier should confirm that the elements of Article 3 and Annex I, not mentioned in the Annex of this Decision, are covered;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas certification undertaken according to certification procedures recognized, by the Commission, will ensure that the requirements of Regulation (EEC) No 1836/93 Annex II-A to G will have been met;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the measures set out in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set under Article 19 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1836/93,</p>
