      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, swine, ovine, and caprine animals, fresh meat or meat products from third countries (1), as last amended by Directive 96/91/EC (2), and in particular Articles 21 (a) and 22 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992, laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (1) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC (3) as last amended by Directive 96/90/EC (4), and in particular Article 10 (2) (c),</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Council Directive 77/99/EEC (5), as last amended by Council Directive 95/68/EC (6), defines a meat product through laying down minimum treatment requirements;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Commission Decision 91/449/EEC (7) as last amended by Decision 96/92/EC (8) lays down the specimen animal health certificates in respect of meat products from bovine animals, swine, equidae, sheep and goats imported from third countries;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas it is necessary to lay down animal health conditions and model veterinary certificates required for imports of meat products manufactured from farmed game meat, domestic rabbits and wild game meat from third countries;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the categories of meat products that may be imported from third countries depend on the health situation of the third country or parts of third country of manufacture; whereas, in order to be able to be imported, certain meat products must have been subjected to a particular treatment;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas a list of third countries from which Member States import meat products is laid down in Commission Decision 97/222/EC (9);</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas it is necessary to lay down the animal health conditions and certificate required to import these products from the manufacturing third country; whereas in order to clarify and simplify the Community legislation, it is justified to group together the animal health conditions and certification required for importations of various categories of meat products and to revoke Decision 91/449/EEC;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas these animal health conditions and veterinary certification apply without prejudice to the requirement for a residues testing programme to have been approved for the third country concerned under Council Decision 79/542/EEC (10), as last amended by Commission Decision 97/160/EC (11);</p>
