      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1713/97 of 3 September 1997 derogating from Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 in respect of the definition of the concept of originating products used for the purposes of the scheme of generalized preferences to take account of the special situation of Laos regarding certain exports of textiles to the Community</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), and in particular Article 249 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1427/97 (4), laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code, and in particular Article 76 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, by Council Regulation (EC) No 3281/94 of 19 December 1994 applying a four-year scheme of generalized tariff preferences (1995 to 1998) in respect of certain industrial products originating in developing countries (5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 998/97 (6) the Community gave such preferences to Laos;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Articles 67 et seq. of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 establish the definition of the concept of originating products to be used for the purposes of generalized tariff preferences; whereas Article 76 of the Regulation provides however, for derogations to those provisions in favour of least-developed GSP beneficiary countries which submit an appropriate request to that effect to the Community;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the Government of Laos has applied for such a derogation in respect of certain textile products; whereas at the Community's request Laos has provided the requisite additional economic information;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the request submitted by Laos satisfies the requirements of Article 76; whereas in particular the introduction of quantitative conditions (on annual basis) reflecting the Community market's capacity to absorb the Lao products, Laos's export capacity and actual recorded trade flows is such as to prevent injury to the corresponding branches of Community industry;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas in order to encourage regional cooperation among beneficiary countries it is desirable to provide that the raw materials to be used in Laos in the context of this derogation should originate in countries belonging to the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) (except Myanmar), the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) or the Lomé Convention;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas any demand to extend application of the derogation beyond the quantities provided for must be considered in consultation with the Lao authorities;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the derogation may not in any case apply beyond 31 December 1998, when the current scheme of generalized tariff preferences for industrial products expires;</p>

      <p n="37">Article 7</p>
