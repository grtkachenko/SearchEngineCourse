      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 288/97 of 17 February 1997 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff and repealing a number of regulations on classification</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2493/96 (2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas it can be difficult to distinguish between some vegetable-based sauces falling within heading 2103 and prepared or preserved vegetables falling within Chapter 20; whereas, to ensure the uniform application of the combined nomenclature, provision should be made to distinguish between the two groups of products; whereas the said sauces usually take the form of liquids, emulsions or suspensions containing very little visible solid matter; whereas a suitable distinguishing criterion would be to pass them through a sieve of a given aperture;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas an additional note should be inserted in Chapter 21 of the combined nomenclature and the corresponding amendments made to Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the regulations or parts of regulations that previously served to classify such products on the basis of criteria other than passage through a metal wire sieve, namely Commission Regulations (EEC) No 314/90 (3), (EEC) No 3044/90 (4) and (EC) No 3055/94 (5), should be repealed;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature Section of the Customs Code Committee,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">Chapter 21 of the combined nomenclature annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="13">1. the following additional note shall be inserted:</p>
      <p n="14">'1. For the purposes of subheadings 2103 20 00 and 2103 90 90, the expression "sauces" does not cover a preparation of vegetables, fruit or other edible parts of plants if the percentage of these ingredients passing through a metal wire sieve, with an aperature of 5 mm, is, after rinsing with water of a temperature of 20 Â°C, less than 80 % by weight, calculated on the original preparation.`;</p>
      <p n="15">2. Additional notes 1 to 4 shall be renumbered 2 to 5.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 2</p>
      <p n="17">Point 2 of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 314/90, point 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 3044/90 and Regulation (EC) No 3055/94 are hereby repealed.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 3</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall enter into force on the 21st day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Done at Brussels, 17 February 1997.</p>
