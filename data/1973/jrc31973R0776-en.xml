      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971 on the common organization of the market in hops (1), and in particular Article 6 (5) and Article 18 thereof;</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 requires that all contracts to supply hops produced in the Community, concluded between a producer or association of producers and a buyer, be registered ; whereas it is accordingly necessary for Member States to institute arrangements for the registration of such contracts;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas to facilitate the registration of contracts concluded in advance it is necessary to provide that these should be concluded in writing and communicated to the body designated by each Member State;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas in the case of contracts not concluded in advance it is sufficient, failing any other supporting documents, that they be registered on the basis of duplicates of the receipted invoices of the deliveries effected;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas deliveries effected under contracts concluded in advance may not tally, particularly in amount, with the provisions agreed ; whereas it is accordingly necessary, in order to have precise particulars of the marketing of hops, that these deliveries be likewise registered;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the registration arrangements are to be applied for the first time to all contracts in respect of the 1973 harvest, including contracts concluded in advance at an earlier date;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas to facilitate the preparation of the annual report on the situation regarding the production and marketing of hops referred to in Article 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 it is necessary that Member States should communicate the relevant data to the Commission, including in particular those obtained pursuant to Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1350/72 of 28 June 1972 on the rules for granting aid to hop producers (2);</p>

The seller may communicate such duplicates either as and when deliveries are effected or all together, but must in any event communicate them by 15 March.</p>

      <p n="29">(b) the amounts harvested.</p>
      <p n="30">Article 7</p>
