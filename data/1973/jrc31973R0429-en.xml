      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">The arrangements laid down in this Regulation shall apply from the date of entry into force of the Additional Protocol.</p>
      <p n="15">Article 3</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
