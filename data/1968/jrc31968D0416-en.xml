      <p n="15">This proposal shall provide in particular for a procedure whereby the registration, supervision, and transport of the stocks held in the other Member State may be ensured and shall take account of the principles set out in Article 6 (2) of the aforementioned Directive.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 3</p>
      <p n="17">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
