      <p n="6">Whereas pursuant to Articles 4 and 5 of Regulation No 121/67/EEC, detailed rules of application must be adopted for buying-in by intervention agencies;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas with the object of organisation buying-in by intervention agencies in an efficient manner, criteria should be laid down for selecting intervention centres for buying-in ; whereas the choice of such centres should be determined by certain technical requirements ensuring satisfactory cold-storage of the meat;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas to ensure that buying-in takes place with reasonable efficiency, a minimum quantity for buying-in should be laid down, varied according to product;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas in order to ensure equal treatment of those who offer their products, what is understood by the buying-in price and the place where the product is taken over by the intervention agency should be defined ; whereas that place may, in principle, be the intervention centre to which the seller intends to deliver his products ; whereas it must, however, be left to the intervention agency to appoint another place, if taking over at the centre designated by the seller is not possible;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the intervention policy of the Community must be efficiently pursued ; whereas, therefore, it is advisable to ensure that the products bought-in and then disposed of satisfy the requirements laid down in health protection directives ; whereas furthermore it is advisable that such products should satisfy certain technical requirements and, so far as pig carcases are concerned, that they should be classified according to Council Regulation No 211/67/EEC2 of 27 June 1967 determining the Community scale for grading pig carcases;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, to enable the Commission to have an overall view of the application of intervention measures, provision should be made for Member States to keep it informed of the details relating to such measures;</p>
