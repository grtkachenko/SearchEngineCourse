      <p n="6">Whereas it is necessary to fix minimum export prices in good time so that professional growers can make their arrangements ; whereas when these prices are being fixed export promotion measures adopted by the Member States in previous years should be taken into account ; whereas in addition, account should be taken of prices on international markets;</p>

These prices shall apply to products harvested in the year following that in which they are fixed. They may be varied for each product according to the countries of destination and the conditions of production and of marketing on the one hand, and to the sizes and other characteristics of the product on the other hand, and shall be determined with particular reference to: - any minimum export prices which may have been applied by Member States during the three years preceding the year in which the minimum prices are fixed;</p>
      <p n="14">- price trends on international markets during the three years preceding the year in which the minimum prices are fixed;</p>
      <p n="15">- the need to maintain a stable export price level and avoid disturbances on the world market.</p>

      <p n="21">2. Where no minimum price has been fixed for a particular size of a given product the lowest minimum export price fixed for that product shall apply to the size in question.</p>
      <p n="22">3. Where the sale takes place at the price of a later stage than that of ex warehouse/exporter, this price shall be fixed at such a level that the amount to be received by the seller, after deduction of the cost of packing, insurance and transport and of any additional costs, is not less than the minimum price.</p>
      <p n="23">4. The minimum price fixed for each product may be reduced by not more than 2 % in the case of cash payment.</p>
      <p n="24">5. Invoices accompanying the products at the time of export shall in particular show: - the price and size of the products;</p>
