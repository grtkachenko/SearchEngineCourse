      <p n="7">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee2;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/683 fixed the provisions governing freedom of movement for workers within the Community ; whereas, consequently, measures should be adopted for the abolition of restrictions which still exist concerning movement and residence within the Community, which conform to the rights and privileges accorded by the said Regulation to nationals of any Member State who move in order to pursue activities as employed persons and to members of their families;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the rules applicable to residence should, as far as possible, bring the position of workers from other Member States and members of their families into line with that of nationals;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the co-ordination of special measures relating to the movement and residence of foreign nationals, justified on grounds of public policy, public security of public health, is the subject of the Council Directive of 25 February 1964,4 adopted in application of Article 56 (2) of the Treaty;</p>

      <p n="17">3. The passport must be valid at least for all Member States and for countries through which the holder must pass when travelling between Member States. Where a passport is the only document on which the holder may lawfully leave the country, its period of validity shall be not less than five years.</p>
