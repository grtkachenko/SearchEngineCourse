      <p n="2">REGULATION (EEC) No 2146/68 OF THE COUNCIL of 20 December 1968 amending Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof;</p>

      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament1;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the procedure for fixing single prices for oils and fats for the Community should be brought into line with that provided for in other sectors subject to a common price system;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas in the absence of a system for the advance fixing of the levy on olive oil, it is impossible for Community importers and exporters to know the cost price of the product when contracts are being concluded ; whereas this situation could make it more difficult to keep oil supplies in the Community normal ; whereas, consequently, provision should be made for the possibility of fixing the levy on olive oil in advance;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas express provision should be made for the possibility of fixing export refunds on olive oil and oil seeds in advance;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Article 35 of Regulation No 136/66 EEC2 provides that the descriptions and definitions of olive oil set out in the Annex to that Regulation are applicable for the purposes of intra-Community trade and trade with third countries except for exports to the latter ; whereas it has proved expedient to extend these descriptions and definitions to exports to third countries;</p>
