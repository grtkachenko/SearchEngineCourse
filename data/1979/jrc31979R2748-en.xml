      <p n="8">Whereas the only purpose of the addition of the sugars (sucrose and dextrose) is to ensure standardization of the substance performing the thickening action (calcium carrageenate), in other words, to ensure a constant activity during use;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the presence of 37 79 % of sugars does not deprive the product in question of its character as a thickener derived from vegetable products of subheading 13.03 C III;</p>
