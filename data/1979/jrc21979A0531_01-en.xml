      <p n="2">COUNCIL DECISION of 8 May 1979 on the conclusion of the Protocol to the Agreement on the importation of educational, scientific and cultural materials (79/505/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas the Agreement on the importation of educational, scientific and cultural materials, known as the Florence Agreement, drawn up on the initiative of Unesco, is intended to facilitate the free flow of books, publications and educational, scientific and cultural materials ; whereas for this purpose the Agreement includes inter alia provision for the non-application of customs duties on the importation of such articles;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas on 26 November 1976 the 19th General Conference of Unesco adopted a Protocol to the Florence Agreement in order to extend relief from customs duties to a number of articles hitherto excluded from such relief ; whereas this Protocol, although constituting an act complementing the Agreement, should nevertheless be considered a separate instrument;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, subject to recourse to the possibilities afforded by paragraph 16 (a) of the Protocol, the provisions of the Protocol are in conformity with the aims of the European Economic Community ; whereas it is therefore desirable to conclude this Protocol and at the same time make the declarations referred to in paragraph 16 (a).</p>
      <p n="9">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="10">Article 1</p>
      <p n="11">1. The Protocol of 26 November 1976 to the Agreement on the importation of educational, scientific and cultural materials is hereby approved on behalf of the European Economic Community.</p>
      <p n="12">The text of the Protocol is annexed to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="13">2. When the Protocol is signed it shall be declared that the Community: - shall not be bound by Parts II and IV,</p>
      <p n="14">- shall not be bound by Annexes C. 1, F, G and H.</p>
      <p n="15">Article 2</p>
      <p n="16">The President of the Council is hereby authorized to designate the person empowered to sign the Protocol in order to bind the Community.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 3</p>
      <p n="18">The President of the Council shall deposit the act of acceptance provided for in paragraph 14 (c) of the Protocol.</p>
      <p n="19">Done at Brussels, 8 May 1979.</p>
      <p n="20">For the Council</p>
      <p n="21">The President</p>
      <p n="22">P. BERNARD-REYMOND</p>
      <p n="23">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="24">PROTOCOL TO THE AGREEMENT ON THE IMPORTATION OF EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL MATERIALS (1)</p>
      <p n="25">THE CONTRACTING STATES parties to the Agreement on the importation of educational, scientific and cultural materials, adopted by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization at its fifth session held in Florence in 1950,</p>
      <p n="26">REAFFIRMING the principles on which the Agreement, hereinafter called "the Agreement", is based.</p>
      <p n="27">CONSIDERING that this Agreement has proved to be an effective instrument in lowering customs barriers and reducing other economic restrictions that impede the exchange of ideas and knowledge,</p>
      <p n="28">CONSIDERING, nevertheless, that in the quarter of a century following the adoption of the Agreement, technical progress has changed the ways and means of transmitting information and knowledge, which is the fundamental objective of that Agreement,</p>
      <p n="29">CONSIDERING, further, that the developments that have taken place in the field of international trade during this period have, in general, been reflected in greater freedom of exchanges,</p>
      <p n="30">CONSIDERING that since the adoption of the Agreement, the international situation has changed radically owing to the development of the international Community, in particular through the accession of many States to independence,</p>
      <p n="31">CONSIDERING that the needs and concerns of the developing countries should be taken into consideration, with a view to giving them easier and less costly access to education, science, technology and culture,</p>
      <p n="32">RECALLING the provisions of the Convention on the means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property, adopted by the General Conference of Unesco in 1970, and those of the Convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage, adopted by the General Conference in 1972,</p>
      <p n="33">RECALLING, moreover, the customs conventions concluded under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council, in consultation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, concerning the temporary importation of educational, scientific and cultural materials,</p>
      <p n="34">CONVINCED that new arrangements should be made and that such arrangements will contribute even more effectively to the development of education, science and culture which constitute the essential bases of economic and social progress,</p>
