      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 6 December 1979 amending Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation (79/1070/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 99 and 100 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the practice of tax evasion and tax avoidance leads to budget losses and to violations of the principle of fair taxation and jeopardizes healthy competition ; whereas this therefore affects adversely the smooth running of the common market;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in order to combat this practice more effectively, cooperation between tax administrations within the Community should be strengthened in accordance with common principles and rules;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, on 19 December 1977, the Council adopted Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation (3) ; whereas such mutual assistance should be extended to cover indirect taxes in order to ensure that these are correctly assessed and collected;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, as a matter of particular urgency, mutual assistance must be extended to cover value added tax, both because it is a general tax on consumption and because it plays an important part in the Community's own resources system;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the provisions of Directive 77/799/EEC are also suitable for value added tax, subject to certain amendments and additions ; whereas it is therefore sufficient to extend the scope of the said Directive,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">Directive 77/799/EEC is hereby amended as follows: 1. The title shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="16">"Council Directive of 19 December 1977 concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the fields of direct taxation and value added tax."</p>
      <p n="17">2. In Article 1: (a) Paragraph 1 shall be amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="18">"1. In accordance with the provisions of this Directive the competent authorities of the Member States shall exchange any information that may enable them to effect a correct assessment of taxes on income and capital and also of value added tax." (1)OJ No C 182, 31.7.1978, p. 46. (2)OJ No C 283, 27.11.1978, p. 28. (3)OJ No L 336, 27.12.1977, p. 15.</p>
      <p n="19">(b) Paragraph 5, as regards the United Kingdom, shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="20">"in the United Kingdom: - The Commissioners of Customs and Excise or an authorized representative for information required solely for the purposes of value added tax,</p>
      <p n="21">- The Commissioners of Inland Revenue or an authorized representative for all other information."</p>
      <p n="22">Article 2</p>
      <p n="23">Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 1981.</p>
      <p n="24">Article 3</p>
      <p n="25">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="26">Done at Brussels, 6 December 1979.</p>
      <p n="27">For the Council</p>
      <p n="28">The President</p>
      <p n="29">L. PRETI</p>
