      <p n="6">( 79/117/EEC )</p>
      <p n="7">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ,</p>
      <p n="8">HAVING REGARD TO THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY , AND IN PARTICULAR ARTICLE 100 THEREOF ,</p>
      <p n="9">HAVING REGARD TO THE PROPOSAL FROM THE COMMISSION ( 1 ) ,</p>
      <p n="10">HAVING REGARD TO THE OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ( 2 ) ,</p>
      <p n="11">HAVING REGARD TO THE OPINION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE ( 3 ) ,</p>
      <p n="12">WHEREAS PLANT PRODUCTION HAS A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY ;</p>
      <p n="13">WHEREAS THE YIELD FROM THAT PRODUCTION IS CONTINUALLY BEING AFFECTED BY HARMFUL ORGANISMS AND WEEDS ; WHEREAS IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT PLANTS AGAINST THESE RISKS TO PREVENT A FALL IN YIELDS AND THEREBY HELP TO ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLIES ;</p>
      <p n="14">WHEREAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT METHODS OF PROTECTING PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS AND OF INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF AGRICULTURE IS TO USE PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS ;</p>
      <p n="15">WHEREAS THE EFFECTS OF THESE PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE WHOLLY FAVOURABLE FOR PLANT PRODUCTION ; WHEREAS THEIR USE MAY INVOLVE RISKS FOR MAN AND THE ENVIRONMENT SINCE , IN THE MAIN , THEY ARE TOXIC SUBSTANCES OR PREPARATIONS HAVING DANGEROUS EFFECTS ;</p>
      <p n="16">WHEREAS , IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS , THESE RISKS ARE SO GREAT THAT THEIR USE CAN NO LONGER BE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY TOLERATED ;</p>
      <p n="17">WHEREAS THE MEMBER STATES HAVE THEREFORE NOT ONLY CONTROLLED THE MARKETING OF PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS BUT HAVE ALSO INTRODUCED , FOR CERTAIN PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS , RESTRICTIONS OR PROHIBITIONS OF USE COVERING ALSO THEIR MARKETING ;</p>
      <p n="18">WHEREAS THESE PROVISIONS DIFFER IN THE VARIOUS MEMBER STATES AND RESULT IN OBSTACLES TO TRADE WHICH DIRECTLY AFFECT THE ESTABLISHMENT AND FUNCTIONING OF THE COMMON MARKET ;</p>
      <p n="19">WHEREAS IT IS THEREFORE DESIRABLE TO ELIMINATE THESE OBSTACLES BY ALIGNING THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS LAID DOWN IN THE MEMBER STATES BY LAW , REGULATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION ;</p>
      <p n="20">WHEREAS IT THEREFORE SEEMS JUSTIFIED , AS A BASIC PRINCIPLE , TO INTRODUCE PROHIBITIONS OF THE USE OF ALL PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS CONTAINING ACTIVE SUBSTANCES WHICH , EVEN WHEN PROPERLY USED FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED , GIVE RISE OR ARE LIKELY TO GIVE RISE TO HARMFUL EFFECTS ON HUMAN OR ANIMAL HEALTH OR TO UNREASONABLE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT ;</p>
      <p n="21">WHEREAS FOR SOME OF THESE PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS NATIONAL DEROGATIONS MAY , HOWEVER , BE PERMITTED TO A LIMITED EXTENT FOR THOSE USES WHERE , FOR ECOLOGICAL REASONS , A PARTICULAR NEED EXISTS AND WHERE THE RISK IS LESS THAN IN THE CASE OF THEIR OTHER PREVIOUSLY SANCTIONED USES ;</p>
      <p n="22">WHEREAS EVEN THESE DEROGATIONS SHOULD BE PHASED OUT AS SOON AS LESS HAZARDOUS TREATMENTS BECOME AVAILABLE ;</p>
      <p n="23">WHEREAS , ON THE OTHER HAND , IT IS NECESSARY TO GRANT MEMBER STATES A LIMITED RIGHT TO SUSPEND TEMPORARILY , ON THEIR OWN AUTHORITY , PROHIBITIONS OF USE IN THE EVENT OF AN UNFORESEEABLE DANGER THREATENING PLANT PRODUCTION WHICH CANNOT BE CONTAINED BY OTHER MEANS ;</p>
      <p n="24">WHEREAS THE DIRECTIVE EXCLUDES PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR RESEARCH AND ANALYTICAL PURPOSES ;</p>
      <p n="25">WHEREAS , MOREOVER , IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO APPLY COMMUNITY PROVISIONS TO PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR EXPORT TO THIRD COUNTRIES , SINCE IN GENERAL THESE COUNTRIES HAVE THEIR OWN REGULATIONS ;</p>
      <p n="26">WHEREAS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS DIRECTIVE AND THE ADAPTATION OF ITS ANNEX TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE NECESSITATES A CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE COMMISSION AND MEMBER STATES ; WHEREAS THE PROCEDURE - FOR THE PRESENT , LIMITED IN TIME - OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON PLANT HEALTH AND INVOLVEMENT OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE FOR PESTICIDES OFFERS A SUITABLE BASIS FOR THIS ,</p>
