      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE of 18 April 1979 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 70/221/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the liquid fuel tanks and rear underrun protection of motor vehicles and their trailers (79/490/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), as last amended by Directive 78/547/EEC (2), and in particular Articles 11, 12 and 13 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Directive 70/221/EEC of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the liquid fuel tanks and rear underrun protection of motor vehicles and their trailers (3),</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, in view of experience gained and of the state of the art, it is now possible to make requirements more stringent and to match them more closely to actual test conditions;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas devices for rear underrun protection are already marketed both separately and after being fitted to a vehicle ; whereas if it is possible to check them before they are fitted to a vehicle, their free movement may be facilitated by the introduction of EEC type-approval for such devices considered as separate technical units within the meaning of Article 9a of Directive 70/156/EEC;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the provisions of this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives Aimed at the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Motor Vehicle Sector,</p>

      <p n="63">This requirement must be satisfied over a distance of 45 cm measured from the rear extremity of the vehicle.</p>
      <p n="64">II.5.3. Any vehicle in one of the categories N2, N3, O3 or O4 (1) will be deemed to satisfy the condition set out in item II.5.1 provided that: - the vehicle is equipped with a special rear underrun protective device in accordance with the requirements of item II.5.4, or</p>
      <p n="65">- the vehicle is so designed and/or equipped at the rear that, by virtue of their shape and characteristics, its component parts can be regarded as replacing the rear underrun protective device. Components whose combined function satisfies the requirements set out in item II.5.4 are considered to form a rear underrun protective device.</p>
      <p n="66">II.5.4. A device for protection against underrunning from the rear, hereinafter referred to as "device", generally consists of a cross-member and linking components connected to the chassis side-members or to whatever replaces them.</p>
      <p n="67">It must have the following characteristics: II.5.4.1. The device must be fitted as close to the rear of the vehicle as possible. When the vehicle is unladen (2), the lower edge of the device must at no point be more than 55 cm above the ground;</p>

The width of the device must at no point exceed the width of the rear axle measured at the outermost points of the wheels, excluding the bulging of the tyres close to the ground, nor must it be more than 10 cm shorter on either side. Where there is more than one rear axle, the width to be considered is that of the widest rear axle; (1)Categories under the international classification set out in Note (b) of Annex I to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers.

      <p n="69">II.5.4.3. The section height of the cross-member must be not less than 10 cm. The lateral extremities of the cross-member must not bend to the rear or have a sharp outer edge ; this condition is fulfilled when the lateral extremities of the cross-member are rounded on the outside and have a radius of curvature of not less than 2 75 mm</p>
      <p n="70">II.5.4.4. The device may be so designed that its position at the rear of the vehicle can be varied. In this event, there must be a guaranteed method of securing it in the service position so that any unintentional change of position is precluded. It must be possible for the operator to vary the position of the device by applying a force not exceeding 40 daN;</p>
      <p n="71">II.5.4.5. The device must offer adequate resistance to forces applied parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, and be connected, when in the service position, with the chassis side-members or whatever replaces them.</p>
      <p n="72">This requirement will be satisfied if it is shown that both during and after the application the horizontal distance between the rear of the device and the rear extremity of the vehicle does not exceed 40 cm at any of the points P1, P2 and P3. In measuring this distance, any part of the vehicle which is more than 3 m above the ground when the vehicle is unladen must be excluded; II.5.4.5.1. Points P1 are located 30 cm from the longitudinal planes tangential to the outer edges of the wheels on the rear axle ; points P2, which are located on the line joining points P1, are symmetrical to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle at a distance from each other of 70 to 100 cm inclusive, the exact position being specified by the manufacturer. The height above the ground of points P1 and P2 must be defined by the vehicle manufacturer within the lines that bound the device horizontally. The height must not, however, exceed 60 cm when the vehicle is unladen. P3 is the centre-point of the straight line joining points P2;</p>
      <p n="73">&gt;PIC FILE= "T0015310"&gt; II.5.4.5.4. The forces specified in items II.5.4.5.2 and II.5.4.5.3 above must be applied separately. The order in which the forces are applied may be specified by the manufacturer;</p>

      <p n="75">II.5.4.5.5.2. The specified forces must be applied by rams which are suitably articulated (e.g. by means of universal joints) and must be parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle via a surface not more than 25 cm in height (the exact height must be indicated by the manufacturer) and 20 cm wide, with a radius of curvature of 5 Â± 1 mm at the vertical edges ; the centre of the surface is placed successively at points P1, P2 and P3.</p>
      <p n="76">II.5.5. By way of derogation from the abovementioned requirements, vehicles of the following categories need not comply with the requirements of this Annex as regards rear underrun protection: - tractors for semi-trailers;</p>
      <p n="77">- "slung" trailers and other similar trailers for the transport of logs or other very long items;</p>
