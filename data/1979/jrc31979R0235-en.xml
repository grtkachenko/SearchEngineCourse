      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EEC) No 235/79 of 5 February 1979 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 on the common organization of the market in hops as regards the verification of the equivalence of attestations accompanying hops imported from non-member countries</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 235/79 of 5 February 1979 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 on the common organization of the market in hops as regards the verification of the equivalence of attestations accompanying hops imported from non-member countries</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 235 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Article 5 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 on the common organization of the market in hops (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1170/77 (3), provides that the equivalence to Community certificates of attestations accompanying hops imported from non-member countries issued by the authorities of the country of origin shall be verified by 31 December 1978 at the latest;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas at present only a limited number of non-member countries have undertaken to ensure that the hops they export to the Community are of the required quality characteristics and have appointed bodies to issue attestations accordingly ; whereas the equivalence of such attestations to the Community certificates has been recognized;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas certain other non-member countries require more time to set up the administrative procedures and checks necessary;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, moreover, the trend on the world market for hops suggests that new producer countries will enter this market in the relatively near future ; whereas it accordingly seems advisable not to fix final dates for the verification of the equivalence of attestations accompanying products exported by such countries to the Community,</p>
      <p n="11">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="12">Article 1</p>
      <p n="13">In the last sentence of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 the words "by 31 December 1978 at the latest" shall be deleted.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="17">Done at Brussels, 5 February 1979.</p>
      <p n="18">For the Council</p>
      <p n="19">The President</p>
      <p n="20">P. MEHAIGNERIE (1)Opinion delivered on 19 January 1978 (not yet published in the Official Journal). (2)OJ No L 175, 4.8.1971, p. 1. (3)OJ No L 137, 3.6.1977, p. 7.</p>
