      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EEC) No 357/79 of 5 February 1979 on statistical surveys of areas under vines</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 357/79 of 5 February 1979 on statistical surveys of areas under vines</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the Commission, in order to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty and the Community provisions on the common organization of the market in wine, requires accurate up to date data on the production potential of the areas under vines in the Community and on medium-term trends in production and supply;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Article 1 of Regulation No 24 on the progressive establishment of a common organization of the market in wine (3) provided that Member States should, not later than 31 December 1964, prepare a viticultural land register which should thereafter be kept up to date;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Commission Regulation No 26/64/EEC of 28 February 1964 laying down additional provisions for the preparation of the viticultural land register, for its management and for keeping it up to date (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1456/76 (5), provides that the complete revision of the Community viticultural land register referred to in Article 3 (1) should take place every 10 years, beginning in 1979;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas a land register in the strict sense involves major administrative work on the establishment, processing and constant updating of a list or register containing information on the owners and on all parcels of land under vines with sufficient details for their identification ; whereas viticultural land registers in this sense have been established only by some Member States, which have moreover been able to update them only partially and at irregular intervals ; whereas the surveys on the areas under vines carried out by certain Member States have different reference years ; whereas these national land registers and surveys do not therefore permit precise uniform synchronized observation of production potential and supply on the Community vine markets;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, in order to assess the Community wine market situation and developments therein, every 10 years basic statistical surveys covering the total areas under vines should be conducted in vine-growing holdings and, in between the basic surveys, smaller statistical surveys should be conducted only on the area under vines of wine grape varieties;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, for economic and technical reasons and in view of their limited significance on the Community wine market, vines cultivated in the open air in Member States with a total area under vines of less than 500 hectares, vines cultivated under glass and vines produced on very small areas solely for home consumption by the growers should all be excluded from the surveys;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas detailed information is necessary on the use of the area under vines for the production of wine grapes, table grapes and material for vegetative propagation of vines, as well as on the varieties and the age of the vines ; whereas the overproduction of table wine in particular can create serious difficulties in the wine economies of certain producer countries ; whereas it is therefore necessary to record separately the area under vines intended for the production of quality wines psr and of table wines;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, in order to keep the development of wine production potential under constant observation, there should be annual intermediate surveys of any changes by way of grubbing, new planting or replanting in the area under vines of wine grape varieties;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the results of both the basic and the intermediate surveys should be forwarded to the Commission as quickly as possible; (1)OJ No C 276, 20.11.1978, p. 1. (2)OJ No C 296, 11.12.1978, p. 58. (3)OJ No 30, 20.4.1962, p. 989/62. (4)OJ No 48, 19.3.1964, p. 753/64. (5)OJ No L 163, 24.6.1976, p. 13.</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas consideration should also be given to statistics resulting from the application of other Community provisions laying down measures for reorganizing Community wine production;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas, since sample survey methods can produce accurate results at moderate cost over large areas under vines, Member States should be allowed to conduct the surveys either exhaustively or by sample, provided that standards of statistical reliability are laid down;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas, in order to be able to assess the production of wine in the Community, information is required each year on yields per hectare and on the mean natural alcoholic strength of fresh grapes, of grape must and of wine ; whereas, in view of the existence of areas with widely differing yields, the area under vines of wine grape varieties should be subdivided into yield classes;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas the Commission must submit reports in order to enable the Council to examine the extent to which the surveys carried out and the information communicated can help achieve the objectives of this Regulation ; whereas, where appropriate, it must propose the harmonization of the methods used;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas Member States and the Commission must cooperate as fully as possible when applying this Regulation ; whereas the implementing rules must be laid down after consultation with the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics, set up by Decision 72/279/EEC (1);</p>
      <p n="21">Whereas the procedure to be followed by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics must be laid down;</p>
      <p n="22">Whereas statistical surveys allow production potential to be adjusted to market demand in good time ; whereas such adjustment can considerably reduce the ever-increasing costs of managing the wine market ; whereas the Community should therefore be made financially responsible with regard to the expenses incurred by the Member States concerned in connection with the first basic survey under this Regulation;</p>
      <p n="23">Whereas the establishment of the survey system under this Regulation requires the consequent amendment of certain Community provisions in the wine sector,</p>
      <p n="24">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="25">Article 1</p>
      <p n="26">1. Member States on whose territory the total area of vines cultivated in the open air is not less than 500 hectares shall carry out: - every 10 years basic surveys on the area under vines ; the first basic survey shall be carried out in 1979, or before 1 April 1980 at the latest, and shall relate to the situation after grubbing and planting in the 1978/79 wine-growing year,</p>
      <p n="27">- annually from the second year after the basic surveys, intermediate surveys on the changes taking place in the areas under vines of wine grape varieties ; the first intermediate survey shall be carried out in 1981 and shall relate to changes during the two wine-growing years 1979/80 and 1980/81.</p>
      <p n="28">2. The wine-growing year shall be that fixed on the basis of Article 5 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79.</p>
      <p n="29">Article 2</p>
      <p n="30">1. The basic surveys shall cover all holdings having a cultivated area under vines normally intended for the production for sale of grapes, grape must, wine or vegetative propagation material for vines.</p>
      <p n="31">2. During the basic surveys, the following particulars shall be recorded for each holding referred to in paragraph 1: A. agricultural area in use;</p>
      <p n="32">B. area under vines cultivated.</p>
      <p n="33">The area under vines cultivated is to be broken down according to its normal production use into: (a) the area under wine grape varieties, further broken down into: - quality wines psr,</p>
      <p n="34">- other wines: - including wine compulsorily intended for the manufacture of certain potable spirits obtained from wine with a registered designation of origin;</p>
      <p n="35">(b) the area under table grape varieties;</p>
      <p n="36">(c) the area planted with root-stock for future grafting; (1)OJ No L 179, 7.8.1972, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="37">(d) the area cultivated solely for the production of vegetative propagation material for vines subdivided into: - nurseries,</p>
      <p n="38">- parent vines for root-stock.</p>
      <p n="39">Varieties which are classified simultaneously as wine grape varieties and table grape varieties shall be recorded according to their predominant use in the geographical units concerned.</p>
      <p n="40">3. During the basic surveys, the following particulars shall be recorded for the area under wine grape varieties: A. Vine varieties</p>
      <p n="41">In the Member States concerned, a separate record shall be made for each geographical unit referred to in Article 4 (3) of those vine varieties which together constitute at least 70 % of the total area under wine grape varieties, and, in any case, of those varieties which constitute 3 % or more of the said area. The remaining varieties may be grouped together according to the colour of the grapes.</p>
      <p n="42">B. Age of the vines</p>
      <p n="43">The age of the vines shall be calculated from the wine-growing year in which they were planted or grafted. The age groups shall be established for each Member State concerned in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8.</p>
      <p n="44">4. This Regulation shall not affect any provisions in the Member States providing for surveys of the areas under vines which include, together with the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, additional information obtained, for example, as a result of a wider field of enquiry than that referred to in paragraph 1 or from a more detailed specification of the particulars of the areas under vines and the holdings concerned. Such additional results must also be forwarded to the Commission.</p>
      <p n="45">Article 3</p>
      <p n="46">1. The Member States concerned shall submit to the Commission before 30 September of the preceding year a detailed description of the methods to be used for the basic surveys and, where appropriate, of the sampling plan.</p>
      <p n="47">2. The Member States concerned shall take suitable measures to limit and, where necessary, to estimate errors of observation for the total area under vines cultivated for each type of production use referred to in Article 2 (2) (B).</p>
      <p n="48">3. The basic surveys may either be exhaustive, or based on random sampling. As regards the results of the basic surveys carried out by random sampling, the Member States shall take all the necessary measures to ensure that the sampling error at the 68 % confidence level shall be of the order of 1 % at most for the survey particulars referred to in Article 2 (2) (B) within the geographical units concerned. The samples shall include holdings of all sizes.</p>
      <p n="49">Article 4</p>
      <p n="50">1. The Member States concerned shall notify the Commission of the results of the basic surveys as soon as possible but not later than 15 months after completion of the field work.</p>
      <p n="51">2. The results of the basic surveys shall be submitted by geographical unit in the form of a schedule of tables to be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8.</p>
      <p n="52">3. The geographical units referred to in paragraph 2, in Article 2 (2) (B) and (3) (A) and in Article 3 (3) shall be as follows: - in the Federal Republic of Germany : the wine-growing regions defined in accordance with Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 338/79 of 5 February 1979 laying down special provisions relating to quality wines produced in specified regions (1),</p>
