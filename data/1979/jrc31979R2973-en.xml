      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2973/79 of 21 December 1979 laying down detailed rules for the application of granting of assistance for the export of beef and veal products which may benefit from a special import treatment in a third country</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2973/79 of 21 December 1979 laying down detailed rules for the application of granting of assistance for the export of beef and veal products which may benefit from a special import treatment in a third country</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2916/79 (2), and in particular Article 15 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2931/79 of 20 December 1979 on the granting of assistance for export of agricultural products which may benefit from a special import treatment in a third country (3), and in particular Article 1 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the United States of America will apply special arrangements for an annual quantity of 5 000 tonnes of beef and veal originating in the Community and meeting certain requirements ; whereas one of the requirements is that this meat must be accompanied by a certificate of identity issued by the exporting Member State;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the certificates of identity are to be issued solely for the 5 000 tonnes qualifying for the special arrangements ; whereas it is therefore necessary to provide for Commission authorization before the issue of an export licence for the meat in question ; whereas, furthermore, the tolerance provided for in Article 2 (4) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 193/75 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2971/79 (5), should not be applied for the quantity exceeding that for which the licence has been issued;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas it is necessary to define the nature of the identity certificates, and the necessary procedures for using them;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the exported quantities cannot be properly verified without special rules regarding evidence of imports into the destination country ; whereas the rules provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 192/75 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2970/79 (7), are the most appropriate ; whereas the penalty for failure to submit such evidence should have a genuinely deterrent effect ; whereas it is therefore appropriate to provide for a higher security for these export licences than the security provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 571/78 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2974/79 (9);</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="28">Article 3</p>
