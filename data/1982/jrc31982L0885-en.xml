      <p n="11">HAVING REGARD TO THE OPINION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE ( 2 ) ,</p>
      <p n="12">WHEREAS DIRECTIVE 78/170/EEC ( 3 ) REQUIRES MEMBER STATES TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT ALL NEW HEAT GENERATORS FOR SPACE HEATING AND/OR THE PRODUCTION OF DOMESTIC HOT WATER IN NEW OR EXISTING NON-INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS COMPLY WITH MINIMUM PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS ;</p>

      <p n="17">WHEREAS THESE STUDIES SHOW THE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INTERVAL BETWEEN THE TIME OF INSTALLATION OF A GENERATOR FOR WHICH TYPE-TESTING IS NOT PRACTICABLE AND THE TIME AT WHICH AN ON-SITE INSPECTION IS CARRIED OUT ;</p>
      <p n="18">WHEREAS , MOREOVER , THESE STUDIES HAVE LED TO THE DRAFTING OF A CODE OF PRACTICE INDICATING THE PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED FOR THE ON-SITE PERFORMANCE TESTING OF A LIQUID OR GASEOUS FUEL FIRED HEAT GENERATOR SUBJECT TO INSPECTION IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INSTALLATION ;</p>

      <p n="52">1 . GENERAL</p>
      <p n="53">1.1 . IN THE CASE OF A HEAT GENERATOR CAPABLE OF USING VARIOUS TYPES OF FUEL ( LIQUID OR GASEOUS ) , THE TEST SHALL BE CARRIED OUT WITH A FUEL OF EACH TYPE WHICH IS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE MANUFACTURER'S SPECIFICATIONS AND AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF THE TEST .</p>
      <p n="54">1.2 . THE EXIT FOR THE FLUE-GASES SHALL BE PROVIDED WITH AN APERTURE FOR THE INSERTION OF MEASURING PROBES AND FOR SMOKE SAMPLING .</p>
      <p n="55">1.3 . THE ACCURACY OF EACH MEASUREMENT MUST BE SUCH AS TO ENABLE THE OVERALL ACCURACY OF RESULTS SPECIFIED BY THE MEMBER STATES TO BE OBTAINED .</p>
      <p n="56">1.4 . THE TEST WILL BE CARRIED OUT WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AND PREFERABLY AT THE NOMINAL CALORIFIC OUTPUT OF THE GENERATOR . WHERE THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE , THE NEXT-CLOSEST LOAD SHOULD BE USED . IF THE GENERATOR IS DESIGNED TO OPERATE AT TWO OR AT SEVERAL LOADS , A REDUCED LOAD TEST MAY ALSO BE CARRIED OUT AT THE REQUEST OF THE MEMBER STATES . THE LOADS USED SHALL BE ASSESSED BY A RELIABLE METHOD .</p>
      <p n="57">1.5 . PERFORMANCE , WHETHER DETERMINED BY THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT METHOD , SHALL BE EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE ON THE BASIS OF THE NET OR GROSS CALORIFIC VALUE OF THE FUEL INJECTED INTO THE BURNER AT THE LOAD ASSESSED AS INDICATED IN 1.4 .</p>
      <p n="58">2 . TEST CONDITIONS</p>
      <p n="59">2.1 . PREPARATION OF THE GENERATOR</p>
      <p n="60">2.1.1 . IT SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER , WITH THE POSSIBLE HELP OF THE MANUFACTURER AND/OR THE INSTALLER , TO CARRY OUT BEFORE THE TEST ANY CLEANING , REGULATION AND PREPARATION OF THE GENERATOR WHICH HE CONSIDERS NECESSARY . THE COMPETENT ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES MAY MAKE SUCH CLEANING COMPULSORY .</p>
      <p n="61">2.1.2 . THE LEAK TIGHTNESS OF THE GENERATOR AND OF ITS CONNECTION WITH THE FLUE SHALL BE CHECKED .</p>
      <p n="62">2.2 . IDENTIFICATION OF THE GENERATOR</p>
      <p n="63">2.2.1 . PRIOR TO THE TEST , THE INSPECTING BODY ( HEREINAFTER CALLED " THE BODY " ) SHALL RECORD ALL NECESSARY DATA FOR IDENTIFICATION OF THE GENERATOR , AND AT LEAST THE GENERATOR'S FEATURES OR SPECIFICATIONS AS STATED FOR EXAMPLE ON THE DATA PLATE AND/OR IN THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSEMBLY AND OPERATION GIVEN TO THE USER WITH REGARD TO MANUFACTURER , MAKE , YEAR OF MANUFACTURE AND HEAT RATING .</p>
      <p n="64">2.2.2 . THE BODY SHALL CHECK THAT THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS ARE FULFILLED FOR ENSURING THAT NO DISTURBANCE OCCURS DURING THE TEST WHICH IS LIKELY TO ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS VALIDITY . TO THIS END IT SHALL IN PARTICULAR REQUIRE THE USER TO PRODUCE THE CERTIFICATES - OR PROVIDE ANY OTHER MEANS OF PROOF - ESTABLISHING THAT THE SAFETY CHECKS LAID DOWN FOR THE BOILER-ROOM AND BOILER-ROOM PREMISES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT . THIS CONDITION MAY BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FULFILLED IN MEMBER STATES WHERE HEAT GENERATORS CANNOT BE INSTALLED OR PUT INTO OPERATION WITHOUT PRIOR SAFETY CHECKS . IF NO SUCH CHECKS ARE REQUIRED BY NATIONAL LAW , THE BODY IS ENTITLED TO REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS BEFORE IT CARRIES OUT THE CHECK .</p>
      <p n="65">SHOULD IT FAIL TO OBTAIN SATISFACTION ON THE ABOVE POINTS , THE BODY MAY REFUSE TO CARRY OUT THE CHECK ; IN THAT EVENT IT SHALL DRAW UP AND AD HOC REPORT .</p>
      <p n="66">2.3 . PRELIMINARY RUNNING</p>
      <p n="67">2.3.1 . PRIOR TO THE TEST , PRELIMINARY RUNNING MAY BE CARRIED OUT BY THE BODY IN ORDER TO CHECK AND PRE-SET THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MEASURING EQUIPMENT INSTALLED FOR CHECKING PURPOSES . THE BODY SHALL ENSURE THAT ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE TO THE REQUIRED DEGREE OF ACCURACY . MORE SPECIFICALLY , IF THE BODY DECIDES TO USE CERTAIN MEASURING INSTRUMENTS FORMING PART OF THE INSTALLATION'S NORMAL EQUIPMENT , IT MUST CHECK THAT THESE MEET THE DESIRED CONDITIONS AS REGARDS STANDARDS OF ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY .</p>
      <p n="68">2.3.2 . IT SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER , ASSISTED BY THE MANUFACTURER AND/OR THE INSTALLER , WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE GENERATOR'S OWNER , TO CARRY OUT ANY FINAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GENERATOR WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY AND TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL EXPLANATIONS OF THE VARIOUS INSTRUCTIONS SO AS TO CREATE OPTIMUM TEST CONDITIONS .</p>
      <p n="69">2.4 . THE TEST</p>
      <p n="70">2.4.1 . TESTING OPERATIONS SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BODY ALONE .</p>
      <p n="71">2.4.2 . THE TEST SHALL BE CARRIED OUT UNDER STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS , WITH THE FUEL AND COMBUSTION-AIR FLOW RATES KEPT CONSTANT .</p>
      <p n="72">2.4.3 . DURING THE TEST THE BODY SHALL TAKE THE COMPULSORY MEASUREMENTS PROVIDED FOR UNDER 3 AND , IF APPROPRIATE , THE OPTIONAL MEASUREMENTS PROVIDED FOR UNDER 4 . IT SHALL DRAW UP A REPORT AS PROVIDED IN 5 .</p>
      <p n="73">3 . DETERMINATION OF LOSSES VIA FLUE GASES</p>
      <p n="74">3.1 . MEASUREMENT OF SENSIBLE-HEAT LOSSES</p>
      <p n="75">WHERE PERFORMANCE IS DETERMINED BY THE INDIRECT METHOD , THE BODY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO MEASURE THE PERCENTAGE BY VOLUME BY EITHER CARBON DIOXIDE OR OXYGEN IN THE FLUE GASES .</p>
      <p n="76">IT SHALL THEN APPLY A FORMULA WHICH IN ADDITION TO THE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FLUE GASES AND COMBUSTION AIR INCORPORATES ADEQUATE CONSTANTS . THE FORMULA AND CONSTANTS MUST HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE MEMBER STATE UNDER WHOSE JURISDICTION THE INSPECTING BODY COMES OR BE LAID DOWN IN A STANDARD .</p>
      <p n="77">IN THE ABSENCE OF OFFICIAL REGULATIONS OR A STANDARD , SENSIBLE-HEAT LOSSES MAY BE CALCULATED FROM THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FUEL , ITS CALORIFIC VALUE AND THE VOLUME OF EXCESS AIR BY USING TABLES GIVING THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF COMBUSTION GASES SUCH AS THOSE ESTABLISHED BY THE 12TH WORLD GAS CONGRESS ( IGU/E/17/73 ) .</p>
      <p n="78">THE ABOVE PROCEDURE SHALL NOT APPLY TO CONDENSING BOILERS .</p>
      <p n="79">3.2 . MEASUREMENT OF FLUE-GAS CAPACITY</p>
      <p n="80">THE BODY SHALL CARRY OUT THIS MEASUREMENT WHERE THE GENERATOR USES A LIQUID FUEL OR A LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS ( LPG ) INJECTED IN LIQUID FORM ; MEASUREMENT SHALL BE BY MEANS OF AN ADEQUATE INSTRUMENT ; THE RESULT SHALL BE EXPRESSED AS A CONVENTIONAL SMOKE NUMBER ( 0 TO 9 ) .</p>
      <p n="81">4 . OTHER CHECKS ( OPTIONAL )</p>
      <p n="82">4.1 . TRACES OF CARBON MONOXIDE</p>
      <p n="83">THE BODY MAY BE EMPOWERED TO CHECK THAT GENERATOR FLUE-GASES DO NOT CONTAIN CARBON MONOXIDE IN SUCH QUANTITIES AS TO CAST DOUBTS ON THE RESULTS OF MEASUREMENTS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH 3.1 .</p>
      <p n="84">4.2 . LOSSES THROUGH THE HEAT GENERATOR CASING</p>
      <p n="85">IN THOSE MEMBER STATES WHERE THERE ARE NEITHER REGULATION NOR TECHNICAL RULES OR OTHER PROVISIONS ON THE SUBJECT , THE BODY MAY BE AUTHORIZED TO ASSESS CASING LOSSES FROM DATA PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER AND/OR FROM SURFACE TEMPERATURES OBSERVED DURING THE TEST .</p>
      <p n="86">5 . TEST REPORT</p>
      <p n="87">AFTER THE TEST THE BODY SHALL DRAW UP A REPORT IN THE FORM LAID DOWN BY THE MEMBER STATE , GIVING THE GENERATOR'S MAIN FEATURES , THE MEASUREMENTS TAKEN , THE FORMULA USED TO CALCULATE LOSSES AND THE HEAT GENERATOR'S PERFORMANCE .</p>
