      <p n="13">Whereas the conditions to be satisfied by the crop and by the seed, including the varietal purity standards, should be amended so as to conform with the schemes for the varietal certification of seed intended for international trade laid down by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); whereas the dates for implementation laid down in the second indent of Article 2 of Commission Directive 78/386/EEC of 18 April 1978 amending the Annexes to Directive 66/401/EEC on the marketing of fodder plant seed (4), as last amended by Directive 81/126/EEC, and in the first indent of Article 2 (1) of Commission Directive 78/388/EEC of 18 April 1978 amending the Annexes to the Directive 69/208/EEC on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants (5), as last amended by Directive 81/126/EEC, should accordingly be adapted to the current situation;</p>
