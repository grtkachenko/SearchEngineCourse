      <p n="3">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1852/82</p>
      <p n="4">of 9 July 1982</p>
      <p n="5">amending for the fifth time Regulation (EEC) No 2960/77 on detailed rules for the sale of olive oil held by intervention agencies</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN</p>
      <p n="7">COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of the common organization of the market in oils and fats (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1413/82 (2), and in particular Article 12 (4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Article 1 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2960/77 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3473/80 (4), stipulates that where olive oil held by intervention agencies is sold for export, the oil must be exported within five months following the month of sale;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas experience has shown that exporters are encountering difficulty in observing the time limit in the case of certain destinations; whereas the time limit should be deferred by the amount of time necessary to allow exports to be conducted properly;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas at present export refunds may not be given on untreated oils; whereas, in order to ensure proper management of sales for export, it should be laid down that oils sold under standing tendering procedures are to be exported in the edible state;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, in the case of export of olive oil sold by intervention agencies, there is a risk that such oils will be blended with untreated oils for speculative purposes; whereas, to prevent this, Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2960/77 should be amended to state that oils sold out of intervention may be blended only with edible oils;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2960/77 is hereby replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="18">'2. In the case of sale for export, the oil must be exported within six months following the month of sale without further processing or after undergoing one of the following processes:</p>
      <p n="19">(a) refining;</p>
      <p n="20">(b) packaging in immediate packages with a content to be determined.</p>
      <p n="21">In all cases the exported oil must be directly edible. It may be blended with other edible olive oils.'</p>
      <p n="22">Article 2</p>
      <p n="23">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="24">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="25">Done at Brussels, 9 July 1982.</p>
