      <head n="1">EEC Council: Regulation No 17: First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty</head>
      <p n="2">REGULATION No 17 First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 87 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee;</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, in order to establish a system ensuring that competition shall not be distorted in the common market, it is necessary to provide for balanced application of Articles 85 and 86 in a uniform manner in the Member States;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas in establishing the rules for applying Article 85 (3) account must be taken of the need to ensure effective supervision and to simplify administration to the greatest possible extent;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas it is accordingly necessary to make it obligatory, as a general principle, for undertakings which seek application of Article 85 (3) to notify to the Commission their agreements, decisions and concerted practices;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, on the one hand, such agreements, decisions and concerted practices are probably very numerous and cannot therefore all be examined at the same time and, on the other hand, some of them have special features which may make them less prejudicial to the development of the common market;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas there is consequently a need to make more flexible arrangements for the time being in respect of certain categories of agreement, decision and concerted practice without prejudging their validity under Article 85;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it may be in the interest of undertakings to know whether any agreements, decisions or practices to which they are party, or propose to become party, may lead to action on the part of the Commission pursuant to Article 85 (1) or Article 86;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, in order to secure uniform application of Articles 85 and 86 in the common market, rules must be made under which the Commission, acting in close and constant liaison with the competent authorities of the Member States, may take the requisite measures for applying those Articles;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas for this purpose the Commission must have the co-operation of the competent authorities of the Member States and be empowered, throughout the common market, to require such information to be supplied and to undertake such investigations as are necessary to bring to light any agreement, decision or concerted practice prohibited by Article 85 (1) or any abuse of a dominant position prohibited by Article 86:</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas, in order to carry out its duty of ensuring that the provisions of the Treaty are applied, the Commission must be empowered to address to undertakings or associations of undertakings recommendations and decisions for the purpose of bringing to an end infringements of Articles 85 and 86;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas compliance with Articles 85 and 86 and the fulfilment of obligations imposed on undertakings and associations of undertakings under this Regulation must be enforceable by means of fines and periodic penalty payments;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas undertakings concerned must be accorded the right to be heard by the Commission, third parties whose interests may be affected by a decision must be given the opportunity of submitting their comments beforehand, and it must be ensured that wide publicity is given to decisions taken;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas all decisions taken by the Commission under this Regulation are subject to review by the Court of Justice under the conditions specified in the Treaty ; whereas it is moreover desirable to confer upon the Court of Justice, pursuant to Article 172, unlimited jurisdiction in respect of decisions under which the Commission imposes fines or periodic penalty payments;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas this Regulation may enter into force without prejudice to any other provisions that may hereafter be adopted pursuant to Article 87;</p>
      <p n="21">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="22">Article 1</p>
      <p n="23">Basic provision</p>
      <p n="24">Without prejudice to Articles 6, 7 and 23 of this Regulation, agreements, decisions and concerted practices of the kind described in Article 85 (1) of the Treaty and the abuse of a dominant position in the market, within the meaning of Article 86 of the Treaty, shall be prohibited, no prior decision to that effect being required.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 2</p>
      <p n="26">Negative clearance</p>
      <p n="27">Upon application by the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned, the Commission may certify that, on the basis of the facts in its possession, there are no grounds under Article 85 (1) or Article 86 of the Treaty for action on its part in respect of an agreement, decision or practice.</p>
      <p n="28">Article 3</p>
      <p n="29">Termination of infringements</p>
      <p n="30">1. Where the Commission, upon application or upon its own initiative, finds that there is infringement of Article 85 or Article 86 of the Treaty, it may by decision require the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned to bring such infringement to an end.</p>
      <p n="31">2. Those entitled to make application are: (a) Member States;</p>
      <p n="32">(b) natural or legal persons who claim a legitimate interest.</p>
      <p n="33">3. Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Regulation, the Commission may, before taking a decision under paragraph 1, address to the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned recommendations for termination of the infringement.</p>
      <p n="34">Article 4</p>
      <p n="35">Notification of new agreements, decisions and practices</p>
      <p n="36">1. Agreements, decisions and concerted practices of the kind described in Article 85 (1) of the Treaty which come into existence after the entry into force of this Regulation and in respect of which the parties seek application of Article 85 (3) must be notified to the Commission. Until they have been notified, no decision in application of Article 85 (3) may be taken.</p>
      <p n="37">2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to agreements, decisions or concerted practices where: (1) the only parties thereto are undertakings from one Member State and the agreements, decisions or practices do not relate either to imports or to exports between Member States;</p>
      <p n="38">(2) not more than two undertakings are party thereto, and the agreements only: (a) restrict the freedom of one party to the contract in determining the prices or conditions of business upon which the goods which he has obtained from the other party to the contract may be resold ; or</p>
      <p n="39">(b) impose restrictions on the exercise of the rights of the assignee or user of industrial property rights-in particular patents, utility models, designs or trade marks-or of the person entitled under a contract to the assignment, or grant, of the right to use a method of manufacture or knowledge relating to the use and to the application of industrial processes;</p>
      <p n="40">(3) they have as their sole object: (a) the development or uniform application of standards or types ; or</p>
      <p n="41">(b) joint research for improvement of techniques, provided the results are accessible to all parties thereto and may be used by each of them.</p>
      <p n="42">These agreements, decisions and practices may be notified to the Commission.</p>
      <p n="43">Article 5</p>

      <p n="51">Article 7</p>
      <p n="52">Special provisions for existing agreements, decisions and practices</p>
      <p n="53">1. Where agreements, decisions and concerted practices in existence at the date of entry into force of this Regulation and notified before 1 August 1962 do not satisfy the requirements of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty and the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned cease to give effect to them or modify them in such manner that they no longer fall within the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) or that they satisfy the requirements of Article 85 (3), the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) shall apply only for a period fixed by the Commission.

      <p n="60">(b) where the parties commit a breach of any obligation attached to the decision;</p>
      <p n="61">(c) where the decision is based on incorrect information or was induced by deceit;</p>
