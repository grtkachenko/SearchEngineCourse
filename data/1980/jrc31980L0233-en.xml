      <p n="40">"Combined lamps" means devices having separate lenses or separate parts of lenses, but a common light source and a common lamp body."</p>
      <p n="41">Item 1.5.20 is hereby amended as follows:</p>

      <p n="43">"Reflex reflector" means a device used to indicate the presence of a vehicle by the reflection of light emanating from a light source not connected to the vehicle, the observer being situated near the source.</p>
      <p n="44">For the purposes of this Directive the following are not considered as reflex reflectors: - retro-reflecting nunber plates,</p>
      <p n="45">- the retro-reflecting signals mentioned in the ADR (European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road),</p>
      <p n="46">- other retro-reflecting plates and signals which must be used to comply with a Member State's specifications for use as regards certain categories of vehicles or certain methods of operation."</p>
      <p n="47">Item 1.6.1 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="48">"1.6.1. Illuminating surface of a lighting device</p>
      <p n="49">"Illuminating surface of a lighting device" (1.5.7 to 1.5.10) means the orthogonal projection of the full aperture of the reflector in a transverse plane. If the lighting device has no reflector, the definition of item 1.6.2 shall be applied. If the lamp glass (or glasses) extend(s) over part only of the full aperture of the reflector, then the projection of that part only is taken into account.</p>
      <p n="50">In the case of a dipped-beam headlamp, the illuminating surface is limited by the apparent trace of the cut-off on to the lens. If the reflector and glass are adjustable relative to one another, the mean adjustment should be used." Item 1.6.4 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="51">"1.6.4. Apparent surface</p>
      <p n="52">"Apparent surface", for a defined direction of observation, means the orthogonal projection of the light-emitting surface in a plane perpendicular to the direction of observation (see drawing in Appendix 2) and tangential to the most exterior point of the lens."</p>

      <p n="60">"1.9. Angles of geometric visibility &gt;PIC FILE= "T0013382"&gt;</p>
      <p n="61">If measurements are taken closer to the lamp, the direction of observation must be shifted parallel to achieve the same accuracy.</p>
      <p n="62">On the inside of the angles of geometric visibility no account is taken of obstacles, if they were already presented when the lamp was type-approved.</p>
      <p n="63">If, when the lamp is installed, any part of the apparent surface of the lamp is hidden by any further parts of the vehicle, proof shall be furnished that the part of the lamp not hidden by obstacles still conforms to the photometric values prescribed for the approval of the device as an optical unit (see figure below)." &gt;PIC FILE= "T0013217"&gt;</p>
      <p n="64">Item 1.12 is hereby amended as follows:</p>

      <p n="66">"A single lamp" also means any combination of two or more lamps, whether identical or not, having the same function and emitting light of the same colour, if it comprises devices, the projection of whose aggregate illuminating surfaces in a given transverse plane occupies 60 % or more of the area of the smallest rectangle circumscribing the projections of those illuminating surfaces, provided that such combination is, where approval is required, approved as a single lamp.</p>
      <p n="67">This possible combination does not apply to main-beam headlamps, dipped-beam headlamps and front fog lamps."</p>
      <p n="68">Item 1.14 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="69">"1.14. Distance between two lamps</p>
      <p n="70">"Distance between two lamps" which face in the same direction means the shortest distance between the orthogonal projections in a plane perpendicular to the axes of reference of the outlines of the two illuminating surfaces as defined according to the case mentioned in 1.6. The distance between two lamps may, however, be measured without determining the outlines of the illuminating surfaces exactly, where the distance is clearly in excess of the minimum requirements of the Directive."</p>
      <p n="71">After item 1.17 the following new item 1.18 shall be added:</p>
      <p n="72">"1.18. Ground</p>

      <p n="78">"3.5.1. be fitted to the vehicle symmetrically in relation to the median longitudinal plane (this estimate to be based on the exterior geometrical form of the lamp and not on the edge of its illuminating surface referred to in 1.6);"</p>
      <p n="79">Item 3.5.2 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="80">"3.5.2. be symmetrical to one another in relation to the median longitudinal plane ; this requirement is not valid with regard to the interior structure of the lamp;"</p>
      <p n="81">Item 3.8 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="82">"3.8. The maximum height above ground shall be measured from the highest point and the minimum height from the lowest point of the illuminating surface.</p>
      <p n="83">In the case of dipped headlamps, the minimum height in relation to the ground is measured from the lowest edge of the reflector."</p>
      <p n="84">After item 3.8 the following new item 3.8.1 shall be added:</p>
      <p n="85">"3.8.1. The position, as regards width, will be determined from the edge of the illuminating surface which is the furthest from the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle when referred to the overall width, and from the inner edges of the illuminating surfaces when referred to the distance between the lamps."</p>
      <p n="86">Item 3.10 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="87">"3.10. No red light emitted from a lamp as defined in 1.5 shall be visible towards the front and no white light emitted from a lamp as defined in 1.5 other than from the reversing lamp shall be visible towards the rear. Lamps used to illuminate the vehicle's interior shall not be taken into consideration in this respect.</p>
      <p n="88">This requirement is considered to have been met if:"</p>
      <p n="89">Item 3.10.1 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="90">"3.10.1. for the visibility of a red light towards the front : there must be no direct visibility of a light-emitting surface of a red lamp if viewed by an observer moving within Zone 1 in a transverse plane situated 25 m in front of the vehicle (see Appendix 3, figure 1);"</p>
      <p n="91">Item 3.10.2 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="92">"3.10.2. for the visibility of a white light towards the rear : there must be no direct visibility of a light-emitting surface of a white lamp if viewed by an observer moving within Zone 2 in a transverse plane situated 25 m behind the vehicle (see Appendix 3, figure 2)." Item 3.11 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="93">"3.11. The electrical connections must be such that the front and rear position (side) lamps, the end-outline marker lamps if they exist, and the rear registration plate lamp can only be switched on and off simultaneously.</p>
      <p n="94">This is not valid when using front and rear position (side) lamps as parking lamps."</p>
      <p n="95">Item 3.15.3 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="96">"3.15.3. In the event of a defect in the concealment control or other defects referred to in points 3.15.2.1 and 3.15.2.2, a concealed lighting device shall be capable of being moved into the position of use without the aid of tools."</p>

      <p n="106">"4.1.5. Geometric visibility</p>
      <p n="107">The visibility of the illuminating surface, including its visibility in areas which do not appear to be illuminated in the direction of observation considered, must be ensured within a divergent space defined by generating lines based on the perimeter of the illuminating surface and forming an angle of not less than 5º with the axis of reference of the headlamp. The origin of the angles of geometric visibility is the perimeter of the projection of the illuminating surface on a transverse plane tangent to the foremost part of the lens of the headlamp."</p>
      <p n="108">Item 4.1.11 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="109">"4.1.11. Tell-tale</p>

      <p n="112">"4.2.5. Geometric visibility &gt;PIC FILE= "T0013383"&gt;</p>
      <p n="113">Since the photometric values required for dipped-beam headlamps do not cover the full geometric field of vision, a minimum value of 1 cd in the space remaining is required for type-approval purposes. The presence of panels or other items of equipment near the light must not give rise to secondary effects causing discomfort to other road users."</p>
