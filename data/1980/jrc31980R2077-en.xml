      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2916/79 (2), and in particular Article 15 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2931/79 of 20 December 1979 on the granting of assistance for export of agricultural products which may benefit from a special import treatment in a third country (3), and in particular Article 1 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2973/79 (4) established detailed rules for implementing the export to the United States of America of 5 000 tonnes per year of beef and veal qualifying for special treatment;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Article 1 (2) of that Regulation specifies that the meat must relate to animals slaughtered not more than one month in advance of clearance through customs for export ; whereas this latter period has been found to be too short in view of logistic requirements and it is consequently appropriate to extend this period to two months;</p>

      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="13">"The meat referred to in paragraph 1 must comply with the health protection requirements laid down by the importing third country and relate to animals slaughtered not more than two months in advance of clearance through customs for export."</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall enter into force on 4 August 1980.</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
