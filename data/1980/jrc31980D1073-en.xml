      <p n="2">COMMISSION DECISION of 24 October 1980 establishing a new Statute of the Advisory Committee on Foodstuffs (80/1073/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Whereas it is incumbent upon the Commission to consult and inform industry, trade and consumer groups on problems arising from the harmonization of legislation on foodstuffs;</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas the existence of the Advisory Committee on Foodstuffs set up by Commission Decision 75/420/EEC (1), as amended by Decision 78/758/EEC (2) provides a means for the Commission of acquanting itself with the views of trade, industry and consumer groups with regard to draft regulatory measures prepared by its departments, in particular where their economic implications are concerned;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas this Committee also gives trade, industry and consumer groups an opportunity to raise subjects connected with the harmonization of legislation on foodstuffs;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas experience gained in the operation of the Committee since it was set up on 26 June 1975 has shown the need for an adjustment to its statute;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the winding-up of the Committee of Commercial Organizations in the EEC Countries (COCCEE), one of the organizations listed in Article 4 (1) of Decision 75/420/EEC, has imposed the need to take into account the existence of new organizations representing commerce at Community level,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">1. There is hereby attached to the Commission an Advisory Committee on Foodstuffs. It may be consulted by the Commission on all problems concerning the harmonization of legislation relating to foodstuffs.</p>

      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">1. The committee shall consist of 10 permanent members and 20 experts divided into five economic groups representing agriculture, commerce, consumers, industry and employees.</p>
      <p n="16">2. Each of the groups listed in paragraph 1 shall have two permanent members assisted by four experts.</p>
      <p n="17">3. The permanent members shall have the task of ensuring the coordination of the work in their group.</p>
      <p n="18">Their term of office shall be three years and shall be renewable. They shall remain in office until they are replaced or until their appointments are renewed.</p>
      <p n="19">The term of office of a permanent member shall terminate before expiry of three years or the resignation or decease of such member.</p>

      <p n="21">4. The bodies and organizations listed in the Annex shall propose to the Commission for their respective economic groups candidates for appointment as permanent members, and shall appoint the experts who will assist them.</p>
      <p n="22">They shall propose to the Commission, each in respect of its own interests, four candidates of different nationality from whose number the Commission shall appoint the permanent members.</p>
      <p n="23">They shall inform the secretariat of the committee, by letter addressed at least eight days before each meeting, of the name(s) and address(es) of the experts they propose to assign to each subject appearing on the agenda.</p>
      <p n="24">5. In the absence of a single Community body or organization representing a group covered by the committee, the Commission shall appoint the (1)OJ No L 182, 12.7.1975, p. 35. (2)OJ No L 251, 14.9.1978, p. 18. permanent members for that group on the basis of the proposals from the most representative among the existing organizations set up at Community level, in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraph 4.</p>
      <p n="25">In this case the permanent members appointed by the Commission shall, with the assistance of those organizations, jointly appoint the experts brought in to assist them.</p>
      <p n="26">6. Organizations and bodies presenting a candidate for appointment as a permanent member may ask the Commission to replace him during the member's term of office.</p>
      <p n="27">Article 3</p>
