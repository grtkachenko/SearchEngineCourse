      <p n="54">Article 10</p>
      <p n="55">Security gradings</p>
      <p n="56">ECI shall be classified according to a scale of security gradings as follows: 1. Eura - Top Secret : where unauthorised disclosure of the information would have extremely serious consequences for the defence interests of one or more Member States;</p>
      <p n="57">2. Eura - Secret : where unauthorised disclosure of the information would have serious consequences for the defence interests of one or more Member States;</p>
      <p n="58">3. Eura - Confidential : where unauthorised disclosure of the information would be harmful to the defence interests of one or more Member States;</p>
      <p n="59">4. Eura - Restricted : where unauthorised disclosure of the information would affect the defence interests of one or more Member States but where a lesser degree of security is required than in the case of documents classified as Eura - Confidential.</p>
      <p n="60">Article 11</p>
      <p n="61">Authorities competent in respect of classification</p>
      <p n="62">1. The Commission shall classify information covered by Article 24 of Treaty: (a) provisionally, where it considers that disclosure is liable to harm the defence interests of one or more Member States;</p>
      <p n="63">(b) definitively, as soon as the Member States have made known the security grading they are requesting. The highest grading so requested shall be applied. The Commission shall notify the Member States accordingly.</p>
      <p n="64">The Commission shall establish and revise periodically, in collaboration with the competent authorities of the Member States, a non-exhaustive list of the categories of information to which a security grading should be applied.</p>

      <p n="66">Article 12</p>
      <p n="67">Classification of documents</p>
      <p n="68">1. The security grading applicable to a document relating to ECI shall be determined solely on the basis of the contents of the document in question and not on the basis of the grading of the ECI subject-matter to which it relates.</p>
      <p n="69">To avoid endangering the security of documents which come under Eura - Secret and Eura - Top Secret gradings, references to such documents shall be kept to a minimum and made in a way which shall disclose neither their contents nor their security gradings.</p>
      <p n="70">The following shall be subject to the security grading which applies to a document: (a) copies of that document;</p>
      <p n="71">(b) documents concerning research or production carried out on the basis of that document.</p>
      <p n="72">2. If a document relating to ECI is made up of several parts, the security grading applicable to the whole shall always be that of the part requiring the highest grading.</p>
      <p n="73">Article 13</p>
      <p n="74">Changes in security grading and declassification</p>
      <p n="75">The security grading applied to any given ECI may be changed or declassified in the manner provided for in the fifth subparagraph of Article 24 (2) of the Treaty and in Article 25 (3) of the Treaty.</p>

      <p n="89">5. The Security Bureau and the official bodies responsible for security provided for in Article 7 shall, each in respect of its own affairs, keep a list of the persons authorised to have access to ECI-graded Eura - Top Secret and Eura - Secret.</p>
      <p n="90">Article 16</p>
      <p n="91">Screening</p>
      <p n="92">1. The object of screening shall be to ensure that the person concerned satisfies the necessary conditions for having access to ECI.</p>
      <p n="93">The scope of the screening shall depend on the security grading for which authorisation is requested.</p>
      <p n="94">2. Screening shall in all cases be carried out under the responsibility of the Member State of which the person concerned is a national. If the person concerned is not a national of any Member State, the Member State in whose territory he has his fixed address or his usual residence shall be responsible.</p>
      <p n="95">If the person concerned has resided for some time or if he has connections in a Member State other than the Member State referred to in the preceding subparagraph, that Member State shall be asked by the Member State responsible for screening to participate in the investigation and shall communicate the results of its inquiries to the Member State responsible for screening.</p>
      <p n="96">3. The relevant provisions and directives adopted in each Member State shall apply for the purposes of screening procedure.</p>
      <p n="97">Save as otherwise determined by the Council in respect of members of institutions and officials and servants of the Community, screening requests made by the Security Bureau shall be addressed to the competent authorities of the Member State which, within the meaning of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, will be responsible for carrying out the screening.

      <p n="99">4. When the screening has been completed, the following procedure shall be applied in respect of members of the institutions and officials and servants of the Community: (a) On completion of the screening, the Member State which was responsible for it within the meaning of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall forward an opinion to the Security Office. That opinion shall state whether or not, on the basis of the results of the screening, there is any objection to the person concerned being authorised to have access to ECI of a given grading. In giving its opinion, the Member State shall take account of all information supplied by any other Member State taking part in the screening.</p>
      <p n="100">(b) If the opinion given in accordance with subparagraph (a) does not contain any objection, the Security Bureau may, if it considers that there is no serious reason for not doing so, grant the authorisation in respect of the person concerned. The Member State responsible for carrying out the screening shall be informed by the Security Bureau of the decision.</p>
      <p n="101">(c) If the opinion given in accordance with subparagraph (a) is unfavourable, the Security Bureau shall be bound by that opinion and shall not grant the authorisation.</p>
      <p n="102">(d) If, after authorisation is granted, information liable to raise doubts as to the suitability of the person authorised should come to the knowledge of the Security Bureau or of a Member State, that information shall be communicated forthwith to the Member State responsible for carrying out screening within the meaning of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2. That Member State shall review its original opinion and inform the Security Office whether it considers that the authorisation should be suspended. The Security Bureau shall, comply with the opinion of the Member State, provided that if the opinion is favourable the Security Bureau considers there is no serious reason for not doing so.</p>

      <p n="106">2. In giving such instructions, it shall be stressed that any breach of the obligation to maintain the security of ECI may also be treated as a breach of the criminal law applicable in respect of acts endangering the security of the State.</p>
      <p n="107">3. Persons who have received such instructions shall sign a declaration confirming that they have received the necessary instructions and affirming that they undertake to comply therewith.</p>
