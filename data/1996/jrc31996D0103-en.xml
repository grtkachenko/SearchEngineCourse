      <p n="6">Whereas application of the provisions laid down has resulted in difficulties in trade in and imports of manure, particularly for holdings in frontier areas; whereas in the light of experience the requirements governing trade in and imports of manure should therefore be amended;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas trade in and imports of unprocessed manure can be a source of animal diseases; whereas trade in and imports of manure from certain animal species should therefore be banned;</p>

      <p n="9">Whereas for the sake of clarity Chapter 14 of Annex I to Directive 92/118/EEC should be redrafted;</p>
