      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles K.1 (4) and K.3 (2) (b) thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the French initiative,</p>
      <p n="6">Recalling that the Cannes European Council, of 26 and 27 June 1995, approved the work relating to the European action plan to combat drugs (1996 to 1999) and recognized the need for an integrated approach in this area;</p>
      <p n="7">Recalling that the Madrid European Council, of 15 and 16 December 1995, approved the report from the group of experts on 'Drugs` and that some of its 66 proposals have already been converted into precise, coordinated operational activities within the European Union, in accordance with the European Council's instructions;</p>
      <p n="8">Recalling that the European Council also invited the Italian and Irish Presidencies to prepare, after consultation of the Member States, the Commission, the Europol Drugs Unit and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, a programme of activities which took account of that report, progress with which would be examined at the Dublin European Council on 13 and 14 December 1996;</p>
      <p n="9">Considering that the Florence European Council on 21 and 22 June 1996 stressed the vital importance of reinforced cooperation between Member States to fight against drugs;</p>
      <p n="10">Considering that the same European Council restated the importance of speedily completing the study on harmonization of Member States' laws and its impact on reducing consumption of and illicit trafficking in drugs;</p>
      <p n="11">Taking note of the report on harmonization of national legislation on drugs as requested by the Madrid and Florence European Councils;</p>
      <p n="12">Recalling the priority attached by the Irish Presidency to the fight against drugs, and the initiatives taken further to the instructions of the Madrid and Florence European Councils to give it a specific content, and in particular the Council resolution on sentencing for serious drug trafficking;</p>
      <p n="13">Considering that Member States fulfil their obligations under the United Nations Conventions of 1961, 1971 and 1988 and that they will examine ways of making strict compliance with those Conventions more effective, in particular by helping third countries to fulfil their obligations;</p>
      <p n="14">Considering that Member States reaffirm their common determination to put an end to illegal drug trafficking in order to protect society from its devastating effects and from the other deep-seated causes of the problem of drug abuse, in particular the illegal demand for drugs and the enormous profits from the illegal trade, and that an approximation of laws and practices designed to render cooperation more effective would be a positive contribution to that objective;</p>
      <p n="15">Noting the memorandum 'On a European social model` submitted by France at the Turin European Council on 29 March 1996, advocating harmonization of national legislation on combating drugs;</p>
      <p n="16">Considering the dangers inherent in the development of synthetic drugs;</p>
      <p n="17">Considering that the report on harmonization drawn up by the Council and the Commission in response to the aforementioned instructions recognizes that synthetic drugs might constitute a priority area for putting the report into practice;</p>
      <p n="18">Considering that, in the absence of harmonized legislation, mutually compatible practices would reinforce European cooperation in fighting drug addiction and in preventing and combating illegal drug trafficking;</p>
      <p n="19">Considering that a high level of European and international cooperation between police, customs services and judicial authorities would help to increase the efficiency of the fight against drug trafficking;</p>
      <p n="20">Considering that the fight against drug trafficking must be combined with an active policy of prevention, care and rehabilitation of drug addicts;</p>
      <p n="21">Noting the Community action programme on the prevention of drug dependence and in particular the fifteen priority actions which it contains;</p>
      <p n="22">Considering that the provisions of this joint action are without prejudice to the general principle that a Member State may maintain or step up its national policy in the fight against drugs in its territory;</p>
