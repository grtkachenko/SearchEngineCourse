      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">The European Union supports the urgent implementation of the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions, with a view to enabling the delivery of humanitarian aid to eastern Zaire and facilitating the return by free consent of refugees to their country of origin and the return of displaced persons. The Community and its Member States will contribute to implementing those Resolutions in ways which they deem appropriate, and which they will coordinate in the manner set out in this Joint Action. The European Union reaffirms the priority which must be given to the return of the refugees to their country of origin and the need to overcome all obstacles to that end. It confirms its willingness to assist Rwanda to create the essential conditions for the return of the Rwandan refugees.</p>

      <p n="17">In the context of support for United Nations coordination, the Council notes that the Commission will ensure coordination of the efforts of the Community and its Member States with a view to providing and delivering humanitarian aid to the refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire as a matter of urgency.</p>

      <p n="23">The European Union will intensify its efforts to restore stability in the Great Lakes Region, in particular by encouraging the setting up of democratic institutions and respect for human rights.

It invites all the parties to redouble their efforts so that such a conference may be held.</p>

      <p n="25">This Joint Action shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 7</p>
