      <head n="1">Directive 96/56/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 3 September 1996 amending Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances</head>
      <p n="2">DIRECTIVE 96/56/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL of 3 September 1996 amending Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances</p>
      <p n="3">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the abbreviation 'EEC` appears in certain provisions of Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (4);</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Article G of the Treaty on European Union replaced the term 'European Economic Community` with the term 'European Community`; whereas the abbreviation 'EEC` should therefore be replaced by the abbreviation 'EC` in the abovementioned provisions;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, however, economic operators normally hold large stocks of labels; whereas certain dangerous substances validly provided with labels bearing the abbreviation 'EEC` may be stored on production sites for a relatively long period before being placed on the market; whereas such a change of abbreviation could occasion extra costs for those operators; whereas a reasonable period should therefore be set during which dangerous substances whose labels bear an 'EEC number` and the words 'EEC label` can still be placed on the market;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas Directive 67/548/EEC should be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="12">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">Directive 67/548/EEC is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="15">(a) in Article 21 (2), the term 'EEC number` is hereby replaced by the term 'EC number`;</p>
      <p n="16">(b) in Article 23 (2) (f), the term 'EEC number` is hereby replaced by the term 'EC number` and the term 'EEC label` by the term 'EC label`.</p>
      <p n="17">However, Member States shall permit the placing on the market of substances whose labels bear the 'EEC number` and the words 'EEC label` until 31 December 2000.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 June 1998 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="20">When these measures are adopted by Member States, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be laid down by the Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 3</p>
      <p n="22">This Directive shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 4</p>
      <p n="24">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="25">Done at Brussels, 3 September 1996.</p>

      <p n="35">(4) OJ No L 196, 16. 8. 1967, p. 1. Directive as last amended by Directive 94/69/EC (OJ No L 381, 31. 12. 1994, p. 1) and by the 1994 Act of Accession.</p>
