      <p n="2">JOINT ACTION of 4 March 1996 adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on airport transit arrangements (96/197/JHA)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article K.3 (2) (b) thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the initiative of 23 February 1995 from the French Republic,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas the determination of the conditions of entry and movement by nationals of third countries into and within the territory of Member States, and combating unauthorized immigration by nationals of third countries, are matters of common interest under Article K.1 (3) (a) and (c) respectively of the Treaty;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the air route, particularly when it involves applications for entry or de facto entry, in the course of airport transit, represents a significant way in with a view in particular to illegally taking up residence within the territory of the Member States; whereas improvements should be sought in controlling that route;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Annex 9 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation establishes the principle of free transit passage through the international areas of airports; whereas States may nevertheless make exceptions to this general principle by notifying the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and requiring an airport transit visa; whereas this possibility should be limited as far as possible to avoid any unnecessary constraint on the development of air transport;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the harmonization of Member States' policies in this field is an accordance with the objectives of security and control of illegal immigration of the Treaty, while contributing to harmonizing the conditions of competition between airlines and airports in the Member States;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas this matter does not concern visas required when crossing the external borders of the Member States and is therefore not covered by Article 100c (1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community; whereas it is nevertheless of common interest and could be more effectively dealt with by means of joint action;</p>

They must above all be satisfied that the application for an airport transit visa is justified on the basis of the documents submitted by the applicant, and that as far as possible these documents guarantee entry into the country of final destination, in particular by presentation of a visa where so required.</p>
      <p n="19">3. With effect from the entry into force of the provisions contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 of 29 May 1995 laying down a uniform format for visas (1), Member States shall issue airport transit visas using the uniform visa format laid down in that Regulation.</p>
