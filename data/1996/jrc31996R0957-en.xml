      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>

      <p n="7">Whereas, under Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 773/96, the time limit within which products are to leave the customs territory of the Community was extended from 60 to 120 days; whereas, under Article 5 (2) of that Regulation, the time during which products may be placed under suspension arrangements in a free zone or free warehouse is 60 days;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas those periods have proved too short for operators to find other outlets for these products; whereas they should thus be extended to 150 and 120 days respectively;</p>

      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="17">It shall apply from 30 May 1996.</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
