      <p n="9">Whereas Directive 96/25/EC aims, in particular, to remove differences between the national legislations concerning straight feedingstuffs and raw materials; whereas, to that end, it introduces a common term 'feed materials` and a definition of that term which covers straight feedingstuffs and raw materials; whereas, consequently, those terms and their definitions in Directive 79/373/EEC (6) should be replaced by the new common term and by its definition as given in Directive 96/25/EC; whereas these amendments have an impact on the definition of compound feedingstuffs;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the list contained in Part B of the Annex to Directive 96/25/EC should be used for the circulation of feed materials whatever their intended use, as well as for the labelling of feed materials used in compound feedingstuffs;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas Commission Directive 92/87/EEC of 26 October 1992 establishing a non-exclusive list of the main ingredients normally used and marketed for the preparation of compound feedingstuffs intended for animals other than pets (7) lays down a list of ingredients for the labelling requirements of compound feedingstuffs; whereas measures should be taken to ensure that Directive 92/87/EEC is repealed with the entry into force of Parts A and B of the Annex to Directive 96/25/EC,</p>
