      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,</p>

      <p n="6">Whereas the braking test can be improved by replacing mean deceleration by a formula defining the braking distance as a function of speed; whereas that amendment will be followed by other changes aimed at improving the safety of tractors and the components involved in their use;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the provisions of this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 74/150/EEC,</p>

      <p n="14">- prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of tractors,</p>
      <p n="15">on grounds relating to braking devices, if the tractors comply with the requirements of Directive 76/432/EEC as amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="16">2. With effect from 1 March 1998 Member States:</p>
      <p n="17">- shall no longer grant EC type-approval or issue the document referred to in the last indent of Article 10 (1) of Directive 74/150/EEC, and</p>
