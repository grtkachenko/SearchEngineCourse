      <p n="8">Whereas, in the interests of consistency and in order to eliminate administrative complications caused by the lack of uniform treatment of ECSC products vis-Ã -vis the products covered by Regulation (EC) No 519/94, the scope of that Regulation should be broadened to include the products covered by the ECSC Treaty and the Regulation amended accordingly,</p>

      <p n="12">'Whereas the common rules applicable to imports shall also apply to ECSC products, without prejudice to any measures implementing an agreement relating specifically to such products;`.</p>
      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 519/94 shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="15">'1. This Regulation applies to imports of products originating in the third countries referred to in Annex I, with the exception of textile products covered by Regulation (EC) No 517/94.`</p>
      <p n="16">Article 3</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="18">It shall apply from 15 December 1995.</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="20">Done at Brussels, 29 January 1996.</p>
      <p n="21">For the Council</p>
      <p n="22">The President</p>
