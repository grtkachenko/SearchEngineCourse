      <p n="7">Whereas information received from Israel has shown that this country will comply, from 1 October 1996 with the requirements of model A in respect of all categories of poultrymeat; whereas, it is therefore possible to amend Decision 94/984/EC accordingly;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas it is also necessary to review the provisions relating to China, following an on-the-spot inspection carried out by the Commission services; whereas this inspection revealed that certification provided was inaccurate and inadequate; whereas a certain delay should be provided for this suspension to come into force to enable the competent authorities in the Member States to implement this Decision and to allow importation of consignments shipped before the date of entry into force of this Decision;</p>

      <p n="21">Article 3</p>
      <p n="22">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 22 July 1996.</p>
