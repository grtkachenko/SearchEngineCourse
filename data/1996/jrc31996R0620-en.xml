      <p n="10">Whereas sound administration of the aid for the dehydrating and/or grinding of fodder demands that the aid be granted solely on agricultural products deriving from parcels, the agricultural purpose of which can be verified by the competent authorities of the Member States;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas rules must be laid down governing the introduction into processing undertakings of products other than fodder to be dehydrated and/or ground;</p>
