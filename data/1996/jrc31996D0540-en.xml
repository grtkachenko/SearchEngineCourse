      <p n="2">COMMISSION DECISION of 4 September 1996 on animal health requirements and veterinary certification for imports into the Community of ova and embryos of the equine species (Text with EEA relevance) (96/540/EC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992, laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subjected to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (1), as last amended by Commission Decision 95/176/EC (2), and in particular Articles 17 and 18 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas by Decision 94/63/EC (3) the Commission drew up a provisional list of third countries from where Member States authorize the imports of semen, ova and embryos of the ovine, caprine and equine species, ova and embryos of the porcine species;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas in Annex D of Directive 92/65/EEC the Council laid down sanitary conditions for the collection, processing storage and transport of ova and embryos and health conditions applied to the donor mares; whereas, however, for imports into the Community of ova and embryos of the equine species it is necessary to require additional guarantees in particular as regards the official veterinary supervision of collection teams;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the animal health requirements for imports of ova and embryos of the equine species must take into account the different conditions under which ova and embryos have been collected, processed and stored or embryos have been produced;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas certain infectious diseases of equidae are transmissible via ova and embryos; whereas therefore specific animal health tests are required to identify such diseases which must be carried out prior to the collection of ova and embryos;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
      <p n="11">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="12">Article 1</p>
      <p n="13">Member States shall authorize the imports of ova and embryos of the equine species complying with the requirements set up in the specimen animal health certificate in the Annex and accompanied by such a certificate duly completed.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">The Decision is applicable from 1 October 1996.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 3</p>
      <p n="17">The Decision is addressed to all Member States.</p>

      <p n="51">- six months, beginning on the day on which the equidae suffering from the disease are slaughtered, in the case of equine encephalomyelitis,</p>
      <p n="52">- a period required to carry out with negative result two Coggins tests three months apart on the animals remaining after the infected animals have been slaughtered, in the case of infectious equine anaemia,</p>
      <p n="53">- six months, in the case of vesicular stomatitis,</p>
      <p n="54">- one month from the last recorded case, in the case of rabies,</p>
