      <p n="42">Explanatory notes</p>
      <p n="43">1. For the authorized warehousekeeper, this certificate serves as a supporting document for the tax exemption of the consignments of goods to eligible institutions/individuals referred to in Article 23 (1), of Directive 92/12/EEC. Accordingly, one certificate shall be drawn up for each warehousekeeper. Moreover, the warehousekeeper is required to keep this certificate as part of his records in accordance with the legal provisions applicable in his Member State.</p>
      <p n="44">2. (a) The general specification of the paper to be used is as laid down in the Official Journal of the European Communities No C 164 of 1. 7. 1989.</p>
      <p n="45">The paper is to be white for all copies and should be 210 millimetres by 297 millimetres with a maximum tolerance of 5 millimetres less or 8 millimetres more with regard to their length.</p>
      <p n="46">The exemption certificate shall be drawn up in duplicate:</p>
      <p n="47">- one copy to be kept by the consignor,</p>
      <p n="48">- one copy to accompany the administrative accompanying document.</p>
      <p n="49">(b) Any unused space in box 5.B is to be crossed out so that nothing can be added.</p>
      <p n="50">(c) The document must be completed legibly and in a manner that makes entries indelible. No erasures or overwriting are permitted. It shall be completed in a language recognized by the host Member State.</p>
      <p n="51">(d) If the description of the goods (box 5.B of the certificate) refers to a purchase order form drawn up in a language other than a language recognized by the host Member State, a translation must be attached by the eligible institution/individual.</p>
      <p n="52">(e) On the other hand, if the certificate is drawn up in a language other than a language recognized by the Member State of the warehousekeeper, a translation of the information concerning the goods in box 5.B must be attached by the eligible institution/individual.</p>
      <p n="53">(f) A recognized language means one of the languages officially in use in the Member State or any other official language of the Community which the Member State declares can be used for this purpose.</p>
      <p n="54">3. By its declaration in box 3 of the certificate, the eligible institution/individual provides the information necessary for the evaluation of the request for exemption in the host Member State.</p>
      <p n="55">4. By its declaration in box 4 of the certificate, the institution confirms the details in boxes 1 and 3 (a) of the document and certifies that the eligible individual is a staff member of the institution.</p>
      <p n="56">5. (a) The reference to the purchase order form (box 5.B of the certificate) must contain at least the date and order number. The order form should contain all the elements that figure at box 5 of the certificate. If the certificate has to be stamped by the competent authority of the host Member State, the order form shall also be stamped.</p>

      <p n="59">6. The abovementioned declaration by the eligible institution/individual shall be authenticated at box 6 by the stamp of the competent authority of the host Member State. That authority can make its approval dependent on the agreement of another authority in its Member State. It is up to the competent tax authority to obtain such agreement.</p>
      <p n="60">7. To simplify the procedure, the competent authority can dispense with the obligation on the eligible institution to ask for the stamp in the case of exemption for official use. The eligible institution should mention this dispensation at box 7 of the certificate.</p>
