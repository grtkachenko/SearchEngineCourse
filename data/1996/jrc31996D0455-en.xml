      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1164/94 of 16 May 1994 establishing a Cohesion Fund (1), and in particular Article 14 thereof, laying down provisions for information and publicity concerning the activities of the Cohesion Fund,</p>

      <p n="18">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="19">(1) OJ No L 130, 25. 5. 1994, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="20">ANNEX I</p>
      <p n="21">DETAILED ARRANGEMENTS FOR INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY CONCERNING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COHESION FUND</p>
      <p n="22">1. Objective and scope</p>
      <p n="23">Information and publicity measures concerning all projects co-financed by the Cohesion Fund are intended to increase public awareness and transparency of Community action in all Member States and to create a consistent image of the measures taken in the four Member States concerned. Information and publicity shall concern all projects which the Cohesion Fund provides with financial contributions.</p>
      <p n="24">These measures are additional to those arrangements for information and publicity undertaken by the Commission and the Member States in other areas of regional and cohesion policies, especially under Commission Decision 94/342/EC of 31 May 1994 concerning information and publicity measures to be carried out by the Member States concerning assistance from the Structural Funds and the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) (1).</p>
      <p n="25">2. General principles</p>
      <p n="26">The national, regional or local authorities responsible for implementing Cohesion Fund projects shall be responsible for all publicity measures on the spot and throughout the territory of the Member State where the project is realized. Publicity shall be carried out in cooperation with the Commission departments, which shall be informed of measures taken for this purpose.</p>
      <p n="27">The competent national, regional and local authorities shall take all the appropriate administrative steps to ensure the effective application of these arrangements and to collaborate with the Commission departments.</p>
      <p n="28">Information and publicity measures shall be taken in due time, once the assistance of the Cohesion Fund is decided. The Commission reserves its right to initiate a procedure according to Article H of Regulation (EC) No 1164/94 (reduction, suspension and cancellation of the assistance), if a Member State does not fulfil its obligations under the present decision.</p>
      <p n="29">3. General principles for publicity work</p>
      <p n="30">Notwithstanding the detailed rules laid down under point 4, the following general principles shall be applied in accordance with all information and publicity measures:</p>
      <p n="31">The media</p>
      <p n="32">The competent authorities shall inform the media in the most appropriate manner about actions co-financed by the Cohesion Fund. Community participation shall be fairly reflected in this information.</p>
      <p n="33">To this end, the launch of projects (once they have been adopted by the Commission) and important phases in their implementation shall be the subject of information measures, particularly in respect of regional media (press, radio and television). Appropriate collaboration must be ensured with the Commission office in the Member State concerned.</p>
      <p n="34">The principles laid down in the two preceding paragraphs shall also apply to advertisements such as press releases or publicity communiqu√©s issued by Member States.</p>
      <p n="35">Information events</p>
      <p n="36">The organizers of information events such as conferences, seminars, fairs and exhibitions in connection with the implementation of projects part-financed by the Cohesion Fund shall undertake to make explicit the participation of the Community. The opportunity should be taken of displaying the European flag in meeting rooms and the emblem on documents depending on the circumstances. The Commission offices in the Member States shall assist, as necessary, in the preparation and implementation of such events.</p>
      <p n="37">Information material</p>
      <p n="38">Publications (such as brochures and pamphlets) about projects or similar measures should, on the title page, contain a clear indication of Community participation as well as the European emblem where the national, regional or local emblem is used.</p>
      <p n="39">Where publications include a preface, it should be signed by both the person responsible in the Member State and, for the Commission, the responsible Member of the Commission or a designated representative, to ensure that Community participation is made clear. Such publications shall refer to the national, regional or local bodies responsible for informing interested parties.</p>
      <p n="40">The abovementioned principles shall also apply to audiovisual material.</p>
      <p n="41">4. Obligations of the Member States concerning information and publicity</p>
