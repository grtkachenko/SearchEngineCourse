      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2491/96 of 23 December 1996 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1734/96 (2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 2564/95 (3) lays down measures concerning the classification in the combined nomenclature of products including a CD-ROM drive and a system for reproducing sound and image on computer ('multimedia`);</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 3009/95 of 22 December 1995 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (4), gave effect from 1 January 1996 to the changes made to the Harmonized System nomenclature in the light of the Customs Cooperation Council's recommendation of 6 July 1993; whereas the changes made to the Harmonized System nomenclature include the introduction, in Chapter 84, of a new Note 5 (D) potentially affecting the classification of certain products that could serve as storage units for automatic data processing machines while performing one or more other functions at the same time;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, when applying Chapter Note 5 (E), it may prove difficult to distinguish between compact discs performing a specific function other than data processing and those designed to play CD-ROMs, audio CDs and photo CDs, which are nevertheless storage units by virtue of Note 5 (D);</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in the interests of the uniform application of the combined nomenclature, the scope of the term 'optical disk storage units` should be made clear; whereas an additional note should therefore be inserted in Chapter 84 of the combined nomenclature; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should be amended accordingly;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas this Regulation covers the products mentioned in items 2 and 3 of the table annexed to Regulation (EC) No 2564/95;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature Section of the Customs Code Committee,</p>

      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">The following Additional Note is hereby inserted in Chapter 84 of the combined nomenclature annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87;</p>
      <p n="15">'2. Subheading 8471 70 51 shall also apply to CD-ROM drives, being storage units for automatic data processing machines, which consists of drive units designed for retrieving the signals from CD-ROMs, audio CDs and photo CDs and equipped with a jack of earphones, a volume-control button or a start/stop button.`</p>
      <p n="16">Article 2</p>
      <p n="17">Points 2 and 3 of the table annexed to Regulation (EC) No 2564/95 are hereby repealed.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 3</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="20">It shall apply from 1 January 1997.</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="22">Done at Brussels, 23 December 1996.</p>
