      <p n="10">Whereas the restrictions on the use of chlorinated solvents laid down by this Directive take into account the current state of knowledge and techniques regarding safer alternatives;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas this Directive is based on a preliminary analysis of the risks posed by the chlorinated solvents and the advantages and drawbacks of restrictions, whereas a general evaluation of the risks to man and the environment of chloroform is being carried out pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 (4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 (5);</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas this Directive does not affect Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers contained in Council Directive 89/391/EEC (6) and in individual directives based thereon, in particular Council Directive 90/394/EEC (7),</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the adaptation to technical progress of the Directives on the removal of technical barriers to trade in dangerous substances and preparations,</p>
