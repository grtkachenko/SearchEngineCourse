      <p n="10">Whereas, in the context of mutual recognition of licences, there is a need to ensure compatibility and interoperability of such licences throughout the Community; whereas, to that end, the introduction on an individual basis of computer technology into the Community model licence should be avoided, while nevertheless leaving space on it for the possible later introduction of a microchip or similar computer device;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the Member States should be left the possibility of entering, in a particular place, information not related to the administration of the driving licence or to road safety on the understanding that such entries are subject to the specific written agreement of the holder;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, with regard to the technical specifications of the Community model driving licence, this Directive applies the 'new approach` to technical harmonization by establishing a general framework for the specifications leaving detailed requirements to industrial standardization procedures,</p>

      <p n="22">When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be laid down by the Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of domestic law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.</p>
