      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy (4) applies to all fishing activities and to all associated activities carried out within the territory and within the maritime waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Member States and also applies to the activities of Community fishing vessels which operate in the waters of third countries or on the high seas, without prejudice to the fisheries agreements concluded between the Community and third countries and to International Conventions to which the Community is a party;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, by virtue of Council Decision 83/414/EEC (5), the Community is a Contracting Party to the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources in the Baltic Sea and the Belts, hereinafter referred to as 'the Baltic Convention`;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission, hereinafter referred to as 'the Baltic Commission`, set up by the Baltic Convention, adopts rules applicable to fishing activities carried out in the Baltic Sea;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas during its twentieth session which took place in Gdynia from 12 to 16 September 1994, the Baltic Commission adopted a number of recommendations relating to monitoring measures applicable in the Baltic Sea;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, under paragraph 1 of Article XI of the Baltic Convention, the Community must incorporate these recommendations into Community legislation, subject to any objections lodged in accordance with the procedure laid down in the aforementioned Article; whereas there are no grounds for raising objections;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it is therefore necessary, on the basis of the recommendations formulated by the Baltic Commission, for certain monitoring measures to be laid down which supplement the monitoring measures laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
