      <p n="10">Whereas Chile is eligible for inclusion in the list of third countries fulfilling the conditions of equivalence referred to in Article 9 (3) (a) of Directive 91/492/EEC;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas Chile wishes to export to the Community frozen or processed bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods;</p>
