      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2449/96 of 18 December 1996 opening and providing for the administration of certain annual tariff quotas for products covered by CN codes 0714 10 91, 0714 10 99, 0714 90 11 and 0714 90 19 originating in certain third countries other than Thailand</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2449/96 of 18 December 1996 opening and providing for the administration of certain annual tariff quotas for products covered by CN codes 0714 10 91, 0714 10 99, 0714 90 11 and 0714 90 19 originating in certain third countries other than Thailand</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV.6 negotiations (1), and in particular Article 1 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas the Community has undertaken, within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO), to open certain annual tariff quotas for products covered by CN codes 0714 10 91, 0714 10 99, 0714 90 11 and 0714 90 19 originating in Indonesia, in other contracting parties to the WTO other than Thailand, in the People's Republic of China and in certain other countries not members of the WTO other than China; whereas under those quotas the customs duty is limited to 6 % ad valorem; whereas those quotas are to be opened on a multiannual basis and administered by the Commission;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas it is necessary to maintain a system of administration which ensures that only products originating in the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China can be imported under the quotas allocated to those countries; whereas, as a result, the issue of import licences should continue to be subject to the presentation of export licences issued by the authorities of those two countries, specimens of which have been sent to the Commission; whereas, as regards products originating in Vietnam, in accordance with the practice followed for several years, import licence applications are subject, in addition to other provisions, to presentation of a certificate issued on the initiative of the exporting country;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, since imports of the products concerned into the Community have traditionally been administered on a calendar-year basis, that system should be maintained;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas imports of products covered by CN codes 0714 10 91, 0714 10 99, 0714 90 11 and 0714 90 19 are subject to presentation of an import licence for which common detailed rules of application are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2350/96 (3); whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1527/96 (5), lays down special detailed rules for the application of the system of licences for cereals and rice;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the usual additional rules for the management of such quotas, relating in particular to the submission of applications, issue of licences, and monitoring of imports should be applied;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, in particular, the origin of the products should be ascertained by providing that the issue of import licences be subject to the presentation of certificates of origin issued by the countries concerned; whereas, however, certificates of origin should not be required for products originating in the People's Republic of China;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, for the sake of sound management of the import arrangements in question, applications for licences may not cover a quantity in excess of that entered on the document certifying loading and shipment to the Community; whereas a maximum quantity per application should also be laid down in certain cases, and it should be stipulated that in no case may applications cover a quantity greater than that for which the aforementioned proof is provided;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas, in cases where the quantities actually unloaded are slightly in excess of the quantities given in the import licences, measures to ensure the release for free circulation of the surplus quantities should be adopted if the country of origin of the products is able to guarantee that the formalities needed for this purpose can be executed; whereas Indonesia and China appear able to meet this condition;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="16">TITLE I</p>
      <p n="17">Quotas</p>

      <p n="23">4. a quota of 32 000 tonnes for the products in question originating in other countries not members of the WTO other than China, of which 2 000 tonnes shall be reserved for the importation of products of a kind used for human consumption, in immediate packings of a net content not exceeding 28 kilograms, either fresh and whole or without skin and frozen, whether or not sliced.</p>

      <p n="30">(c) in the case of products originating in Indonesia and China, they are accompanied by the relevant export licences as referred to in Title II issued by the authorities, duly completed in accordance with the specimen in Annexes II and III. The originals of such licences shall be kept by the authority issuing them. However, where the import licence applications cover only part of the quantity indicated on the export licence, the issuing authority shall indicate on the original the quantity in respect of which the original was used and, after stamping it, shall return the original to the party concerned. Only the quantity indicated in Section 7 of export licences in the case of Indonesian exports and in Section 9 of export licences in the case of Chinese exports shall be taken into consideration for the purposes of issuing the import licences;</p>
      <p n="31">(d) they relate to a quantity which does not exceed the quantity indicated in the documents referred to in points (a), (b) and (c).</p>

      <p n="42">2. Export licences shall be duly authenticated where they indicate the date of issue and bear the stamp of the issuing authority and the signature of the persons authorized to sign them.</p>
      <p n="43">TITLE III</p>

      <p n="87">The Commission, on receipt of the information referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, shall contact the Indonesian authorities with a view to the issue of new export licences.</p>
      <p n="88">Securities shall be released on presentation to the competent authorities of the Member State in which release for free circulation is to take place of a supplementary import licence for the excess quantity in question. Application for such licences shall not be subject to the lodging of a security against the licence as provided for in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 and Article 7 of this Regulation.

      <p n="101">Once the supplementary import licence has been processed and stamped by the competent authority when the security is released, the licence shall be returned to the issuing authority as soon as possible.</p>
      <p n="102">3. Application of paragraphs 1 and 2 may not result in importation of quantities of goods exceeding the overall quota authorized for the year. If, when a supplementary import licence is issued, it is found that the overall quota has been exceeded, the quantity covered by the supplementary licence shall be deducted from the overall quota authorized for the following year.</p>
      <p n="103">Article 11</p>
      <p n="104">The quantities of products to which each import licence issued relates shall be deducted from the overall quota for the year of issue of those licences.</p>
