      <p n="7">Whereas the condition of the economy of those departments and the requirements for their economic and social development make it appropriats to apply Articles 52 to 58 and certain provisions of Article 106 of the Treaty;</p>

      <p n="13">Without prejudice to the implementation of the measures adopted pursuant to the Treaty and to the Implementing Convention of 25 March 1957 and of those to be adopted pursuant to Article 1, the right of establishment in the French overseas departments shall be progressively extended to the companies or firms and nationals of Member States other than France, so that all discrimination may disappear not later than three years after the application of this Decision.</p>
      <p n="14">The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall issue the necessary directives for the implementation of that progressive extension.</p>

      <p n="18">Article 4</p>
