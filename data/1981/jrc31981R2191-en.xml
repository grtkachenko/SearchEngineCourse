      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2191/81 of 31 July 1981 on the granting of aid for the purchase of butter by non-profit-making institutions and organizations</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece, and in particular Articles 12 (3) and 28 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 878/77 of 26 April 1977 on the exchange rates to be applied in agriculture (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 850/81 (3), and in particular Article 4 (3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1723/81 of 24 June 1981 laying down general rules on measures to maintain the level of utilization of butter by certain categories of consumers and industries (4) provides for the possibility of granting aid in respect of butter available on the market, so as to enable that product to be purchased at a reduced price, in particular by non-profit-making institutions and organizations;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the relatively small quantities of butter at present in public stocks will shortly lead to sales from public stocks being suspended by virtue of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1717/72 of 8 August 1972 on the sale of butter at a reduced price to non-profit-making institutions and organizations (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3474/80 (6) ; whereas, in these circumstances, recourse should be had to Regulation (EEC) No 1723/81 by making provision for the granting of aid for butter purchased by non-profit-making institutions and organizations;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, however, aid should only be granted in respect of butter meeting the top-grade requirements referred to in Article 1 (3) (b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 985/68 laying down general rules for intervention on the market in butter and cream (7), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece ; whereas, for reasons of control, the aid should be limited to butter purchased in the Member State of the beneficiary from an approved supplier in that Member State;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas care should be taken to ensure that aid under this Regulation is not duplicating aid for direct consumption, in pursuance of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1269/79 of 25 June 1969 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 854/81 (9), or duplicating the reduction of the special levy, in pursuance of Council Regulation (EEC) No 858/81 of 1 April 1981 (10), in the case of New Zealand butter marketed in the United Kingdom;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, to facilitate supervision, the marking to be shown on the packages of the butter qualifying for aid should be specified;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the Member States should inform the Commission of the methods they adopt to implement the measures provided for in this Regulation;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 878/77 provides that, as regards the effect on rights and obligations existing at the moment when the representative rate is altered, the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1134/68 of 30 July 1968 laying down rules for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 653/68 on conditions for alterations to the value of the unit of account used for the common agricultural policy (11) are to apply ; whereas, under Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1134/68, the sums referred to in (1) OJ No L 148, 28.6.1968, p. 13. (2) OJ No L 106, 29.4.1977, p. 27. (3) OJ No L 90, 4.4.1981, p. 1. (4) OJ No L 172, 30.6.1981, p. 14. (5) OJ No L 181, 9.8.1972, p. 11. (6) OJ No L 363, 31.12.1980, p. 50. (7) OJ No L 169, 18.7.1968, p. 1. (8) OJ No L 161, 29.6.1979, p. 8. (9) OJ No L 90, 4.4.1981, p. 18. (10) OJ No L 90, 4.4.1981, p. 14. (11) OJ No L 188, 1.8.1968, p. 1. the said Article are to be paid at the conversion rate which obtained at the time when the transaction or part transaction is carried out ; whereas, however, by virtue of Article 4 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 878/77, derogations may be made from the abovementioned provisions ; whereas, as regards the conversion into national currency of the aid provided for in this Regulation, the representative rate adopted should be the rate in force on the first day of the month for which the voucher which gives entitlement to the aid is valid;</p>

      <p n="34">2. The voucher shall be issued subject to: (a) a written undertaking from the beneficiary to the competent authority to make the butter available only to consumers for which it is itself responsible and to pay back the amount of the aid where it is established that the butter bought under this Regulation has been deflected from its intended use;</p>
