      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2180/81 of 30 July 1981 laying down rules implementing restrictions on investment aids for pig production</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1945/81 of 30 June 1981 restricting investment aids for pig production (1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, for the purpose of applying the restrictions on investment aids for pig production laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1945/81, it is necessary to fix the ratio for converting fattening pig places to breeding sow places;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the extent of the authorization referred to in Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1945/81 should be defined and minimum requirements to be met by Member States' applications for such authorization should be laid down;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, with a view to assessing the impact of such authorizations, it is necessary to require Member States receiving such authorization to present an annual report on the subject;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the Standing Committee on Agricultural Structure has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman;</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">The 550 pig places referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1945/81 shall be fattening pig places. One breeding sow place shall be equivalent to 6 75 fattening pig places.</p>
      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">1. The authorization given to a Member State to alter the number of 550 pig places in the context of a farm development plan shall be restricted to special cases in which the expected income from the farm under the plan does not guarantee the comparable earned income for 1 75 man-work units.</p>
      <p n="15">2. The number of pig-places may be increased pursuant to Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1945/81 only to the extent necessary to guarantee the comparable earned income for a maximum of 1 75 man-work units under the development plan concerned.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 3</p>
      <p n="17">A Member State applying for authorization under Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1945/81 must at the same time provide the Commission with a detailed description of the method of calculation. In particular, the following information relating to the pig operation must be included in the method of calculation: - the costs related to the fattening pig and breeding sow places,</p>
      <p n="18">- the prices to be paid for piglets, fattening pigs, breeding sows and feed,</p>
      <p n="19">- the number of progeny per sow per year,</p>
      <p n="20">- the number of pigs kept per fattening place per year.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 4</p>
      <p n="22">A Member State receiving authorization to alter the number of pig places shall submit to the Commission an annual report, before 1 May of the following year, on the specific cases in which the number of pig places has been altered in the context of a farm development plan. The report shall in particular contain information on the number of special cases and the number of pig places involved in each case.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 5</p>
      <p n="24">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. (1) OJ No L 197, 20.7.1981, p. 31.</p>
      <p n="25">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="26">Done at Brussels, 30 July 1981.</p>
      <p n="27">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="28">The President</p>
