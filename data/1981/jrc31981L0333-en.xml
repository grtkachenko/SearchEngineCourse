      <p n="10">amending Directive 79/490/EEC adapting to technical progress Council Directive 70/221/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to liquid fuel tanks and rear underrun protection of motor vehicles and their trailers</p>

      <p n="12">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ,</p>
      <p n="13">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community ,</p>
      <p n="14">Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers ( 1 ) , as last amended by Directive 80/1267/EEC ( 2 ) , and in particular Article 13 thereof ,</p>
      <p n="15">Having regard to Council Directive 70/221/EEC of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to liquid fuel tanks and rear underrun protection of motor vehicles and their trailers ( 3 ) , as last amended by Directive 79/490/EEC ( 4 ) , and in particular Article 3 thereof ,</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas , experience has shown that the current wording of item II.5.2 of the Annex to Directive 79/490/EEC relating to the rear underrun protection of vehicles in categories M1 , M2 , M3 , N1 , O1 and O2 is rather vague in respect of the width over which the requirement must be satisfied ; whereas this may lead to different requirements by different standardization services with the risk of contradictions with Council Directive 74/483/EEC ( 5 ) relating to external projections of vehicles in category M1 , and also of technical barriers to trade ,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE :</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
      <p n="19">Directive 79/490/EEC is hereby amended as follows :</p>
      <p n="20">The text of item II.5.2 of the Annex shall be replaced by the following text :</p>
      <p n="21">" II.5.2 . Any vehicle in one of the categories M1 , M2 , M3 , N1 , O1 , or O2 ( categories under the international classification set out in note ( b ) of Annex I to Council Directive 70/156/EEC ) will be deemed to satisfy the condition set out in item II.5.1 :</p>
      <p n="22">_ if it satisfies the conditions set out in item II.5.3 , or</p>
      <p n="23">_ if the ground clearance of the rear part of the unladen vehicle does not exceed 55 cm over a width which is not shorter than that of the rear axle by more than 10 cm on either side ( excluding any tyre bulging close to the ground ) .</p>
      <p n="24">Where there is more than one rear axle , the width to be considered is that of the widest .</p>
      <p n="25">This requirement must be satisfied at least on a line at a distance of not more than 45 cm from the rear extremity of the vehicle . "</p>
      <p n="26">Article 2 Before 1 October 1981 , Member States shall bring into force the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive , and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof .</p>
      <p n="27">Article 3</p>
      <p n="28">This Directive is addressed to the Member States .</p>
      <p n="29">Done at Brussels , 13 April 1981 .</p>
      <p n="30">For the Commission</p>
