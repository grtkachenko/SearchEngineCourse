      <p n="3">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2143/81</p>
      <p n="4">of 27 July 1981</p>
      <p n="5">amending Regulation No 79/65/EEC setting up a network for the collection of accountancy data on the incomes and business operation of agricultural holdings in the European Economic Community</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN</p>
      <p n="7">COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="11">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas by Regulation No 79/65/EEC (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2910/73 (5), the Council set up a network for the collection of accountancy data on the incomes and business operation of agricultural holdings in the European Economic Community;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the field of survey of the data network must comprise all the agricultural holdings of a certain economic size, irrespective of any outside work the operator may engage in;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas in order to obtain accounting results that are sufficiently homogeneous at Community level, the returning holdings should be distributed among the various divisions and the various categories of holdings on the basis of a stratification of the field of survey based on the Community typology of agricultural holdings as established by Decision 78/463/EEC (6);</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas all the returning holdings surveyed in the Member States for the purposes of recording farm incomes in order to provide guidelines for agricultural policies should belong to the Community data network and the number of returning holdings must be increased accordingly; whereas this number must be able to develop within certain limits and in particular on the basis of developments in the field of agriculture and the information requirements of the common agricultural policy;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas returning holdings must be selected in accordance with the rules laid down in the context of a selection plan aimed at obtaining a representative accounting sample of the field of survey;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas, in view of experience gained, it is desirable that the main decisions concerning the selection of returning holdings, particularly the establishment of the selection plan, should be adopted at national level; whereas, consequently, it is at that level that a body should be made responsible for this task; whereas those Member States which have several divisions should, however, be free to maintain regional committees;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas the national liaison agency must play a key role in the management of the data network; whereas, to this end, it should be entrusted with new duties;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas experience shows that it is no longer desirable to make provision for supplementary terms to be included in the contract to be concluded between the Member State and the accountancy offices;</p>
      <p n="20">Whereas the divisions of the data network must, as far as possible, be identical with those used for the presentation of other regional data that are essential in order to provide guidelines for the common agricultural policy; whereas, in this respect, the Annex to Regulation No 79/65/EEC should be amended,</p>
      <p n="21">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="22">Article 1</p>
