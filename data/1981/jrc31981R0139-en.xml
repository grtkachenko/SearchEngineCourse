      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece (2), and in particular Article 11 (5) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 162/74 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2014/75 (4), defined the conditions for the admission of certain kinds of frozen beef and veal to subheading 02.01 A II a) 2 dd) 22 bbb) of the Common Customs Tariff ; whereas since that Regulation was adopted the Common Customs Tariff has been amended ; whereas, in the interests of clarity, the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 162/74 should be adapted;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the development of trade between the Community and non-member countries in beef and veal products has led to new forms of certificate being designed so as to improve efficiency in this trade ; whereas it seems appropriate for the certificate of authenticity provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 162/74 to be aligned with the certificates for other products in the beef and veal sector;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the products falling within subheading 02.01 A II b) 4 bb) 22 of the Common Customs Tariff were defined by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 586/77 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 882/79 (6);</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the provisions of this Regulation are without prejudice to the Community provisions adopted with regard to veterinary legislation and foodstuffs legislation with the aim of protecting human and animal health and preventing falsification and fraud;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,</p>

      <p n="18">3. The forms shall be completed either in typescript or by hand. In the latter case, ink and block capitals shall be used.</p>

(6) OJ No L 111, 4.5.1979, p. 14. 2. The certificate of authenticity shall be deemed to be duly endorsed if it specifies the place and date of issue and if it bears the stamp of the issuing agency and the signature of the person or persons empowered to sign it.</p>
      <p n="25">A printed seal may be substituted for the stamp.</p>
      <p n="26">Article 5</p>
