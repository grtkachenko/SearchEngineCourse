      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1842/81 of 3 July 1981 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 relating to general rules for granting refunds adjusted in the case of cereals exported in the form of certain spirituous beverages</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1842/81 of 3 July 1981 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 relating to general rules for granting refunds adjusted in the case of cereals exported in the form of certain spirituous beverages</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1784/81 (2), and in particular Articles 16 (6) and 24 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 of 28 April 1981 laying down general rules for granting refunds adjusted in the case of cereals exported in the form of certain spirituous beverages and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80 concerning certain products not covered by Annex II to the Treaty (3), and in particular Article 12 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas pursuant to Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 the rate of the refund is that applicable on the day on which the cereals are placed under control ; whereas the date to be taken into consideration must therefore be the date on which the customs authorities accept the payment declaration by the person concerned by which he manifests his intention to distil and to export the products and qualify for a refund ; whereas this declaration must include the information necessary for calculating the refunds;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, for the purposes of Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 and in particular for determining the coefficient, it is necessary to define what is meant by "total export quantities" and "total quantities released to the market";</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas it is necessary for the application of this Regulation for it to be known that the products have left the Community and in certain cases also for their destination to be known ; whereas for this reason it is necessary to have recourse to the definition of exportation set out in Council Directive 81/177/EEC (4) and to the proofs provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2730/79 of 29 November 1979 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1663/81 (6);</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas it should be laid down that the Member States shall pass on to the Commission the necessary information;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="14">1. Receipt of the export refund for cereals exported in the form of one of the spirituous beverages covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 shall be subject to the lodging with the competent authorities of a declaration, termed "payment declaration" below, in which the operator states his intention to distil the cereals in order to produce one of the spirituous beverages covered by that Regulation.</p>
      <p n="15">2. The payment declaration shall include all the particulars as are necessary for determining the refund, in particular: (a) a discription of the cereals or malt in accordance with the nomenclature used for refunds;</p>

      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">1. At the time of acceptance of the payment declaration, the cereals or malt shall be placed under customs control or under the administrative control referred to in Article 3 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 until such time as they have been distilled.</p>
      <p n="19">2. The date of acceptance of the payment declaration shall determine the rate of the refund.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 3</p>
      <p n="21">1. The result of the examination of the payment declaration, whether or not combined with the examination of the cereals or malt, shall be used for determining the refund.</p>

      <p n="23">Article 4</p>
      <p n="24">1. As regards procedures for checking the distillation process, including the yield, the cereals or malt shall be subject to the same rules as apply in respect of inward processing arrangements.</p>

      <p n="26">3. No refund shall be granted where the cereals or malt are not of sound and fair merchantable quality.</p>
      <p n="27">Article 5</p>

      <p n="31">4. Except in cases of force majeure the documents required for the granting of the refund must be lodged within 12 months of the day on which the competent authorities accepted the payment declaration, otherwise entitlement to the refund shall be lost.</p>

      <p n="33">For the purposes of Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81: (a) "total export quantities" means the quantities of spirituous beverages fulfilling the terms of Article 9 (2) of the Treaty and exported to a destination for which the refund applies.

The quantities exported may be determined from existing data.</p>
      <p n="37">Article 8</p>
      <p n="38">For the purposes of Article 6 (a), spirituous beverages shall be deemed to have been exported on the day on which customs export formalities were completed.</p>
      <p n="39">However, if proof of export is furnished, pursuant to Article 14 (2), too late for the consignment to be counted in with exports carried out during the same calendar year, the export consignment in question shall be included with exports carried out in the following calendar year.</p>
      <p n="40">Article 9</p>
      <p n="41">The coefficient referred to in Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 shall be fixed before 1 August each year.</p>

      <p n="45">Article 11</p>

Advance payment, at the time the cereals or malt are placed under control, of a sum equal to the refund shall be subject to the lodging of a security equal to the amount to be paid plus: (a) 5 % if the operator undertakes to distil the cereals within 30 days of the date on which the payment declaration was accepted;</p>
      <p n="47">(b) 15 % in other cases.</p>
      <p n="48">2. The refund due shall be set off against the amount paid in advance when proof of distillation of the cereals or malt is produced and, if paragraph 1 (a) applies, distillation has been carried out within the prescribed period.</p>
      <p n="49">3. The release of the security shall be subject to the production of proof that the cereals or malt have been distilled, where appropriate, before the expiry of the prescribed period. On application by the person concerned, Member States may release the security by instalments in proportion to the quantities of cereals or malt in respect of which the proof of distillation laid down has been provided.</p>
