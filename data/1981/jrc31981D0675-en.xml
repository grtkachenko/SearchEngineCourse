      <p n="2">COMMISSION DECISION of 28 July 1981 establishing that particular sealing systems are "non-reusable systems" within the meaning of Council Directives 66/400/EEC, 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 69/208/EEC and 70/458/EEC (81/675/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 66/400/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of beet seed (1), as last amended by Directive 78/692/EEC (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed (3), as last amended by Directive 81/126/EEC (4), and in particular Article 9 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Directive 66/402/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of cereal seed (5), as last amended by Directive 81/126/EEC, and in particular Article 9 (1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 69/208/EEC of 30 June 1969 on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants (6), as last amended by Directive 81/126/EEC, and in particular Article 9 (1) thereof,</p>

      <p n="10">Whereas, in accordance with the abovementioned provisions, packages of seed shall normally be sealed in such a way that the sealing system comprises either the prescribed official label or an official seal;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas these measures are not necessary where a non-reusable sealing system is used;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas in the interest of a uniform application of the relevant Community provisions, it should be established that certain current sealing systems are "non-reusable sealing systems";</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it is understood that the system now used exclusively in the case of cereal seed is one the use of which should show a tendency to decrease in favour of new systems offering greater guarantees of effectiveness and should be reconsidered after five years;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>

      <p n="18">(b) bags of non-woven material, which are closed by stitching, provided that there is, at least at one side of the opening, an indelible imprint of a number scale, beginning with Number 1 at the upper edge, or a similar imprint (letters, design), which shows that the bags have retained their original dimensions.</p>
      <p n="19">(1) OJ No 125, 11.7.1966, p. 2290/66. (2) OJ No L 236, 26.8.1978, p. 13. (3) OJ No 125, 11.7.1966, p. 2298/66. (4) OJ No L 67, 12.3.1981, p. 36. (5) OJ No 125, 11.7.1966, p. 2305/66.
