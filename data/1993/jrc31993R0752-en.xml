      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>

      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92 of 9 December 1992 (1) on the export of cultural goods, and in particular Article 7 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">After consulting the Advisory Committee on Cultural Goods,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas it is necessary to adopt provisions for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92, which provides, inter alia, for the establishment of an export licensing system for certain categories of cultural goods defined in the Annex to that Regulation;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas in order to ensure that the export licences provided for by the said Regulation are uniform it is necessary to lay down rules governing the drawing up, issuing and use of the form; whereas to that end a specimen licence should be drawn up;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas export licences must be made out in one of the official languages of the Community,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="21">3. Forms shall be printed and filled out in an official language of the Communities designated by the competent authorities of the issuing Member State. The competent authorities of the Member State in which the form is presented may ask for it to be translated into the language, or one of the official languages, of that Member State. In this case, the translation costs shall be met by the licence holder.</p>
      <p n="22">4. Member States shall be responsible:</p>
      <p n="23">- for having the forms printed, bearing the printer's name and address or identifying mark,</p>
