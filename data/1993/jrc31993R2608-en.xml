      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2608/93 of 23 September 1993 amending Annexes I, II and III of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 207/93 (2), and in particular Article 13 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas plants collected in natural areas which have not undergone treatment with products which are not authorized in organic farming should be regarded as having been obtained according to the organic production method, wherever such collection has been made in areas and by persons inspected under the provisions of the inspection system provided for in Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91; whereas, therefore, Annexes I and III have to be amended;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas in the case of certain apple-tree varieties the treatment of the leaves with calcium chloride appears indispensable to satisfy adequately their nutritional need of calcium; whereas the practice does not have any significant effect on the environment; whereas, therefore, calcium chloride should be inserted into part A of Annex II;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas according to the provisions of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 importers of products from third countries are obliged to submit their undertaking to the inspection system referred to in Article 9; whereas, therefore, detailed implementation rules have to be developed to adjust the current provisions of Annex III to the situation of importers of products into the Community; whereas for reasons of clarity those provisions have been grouped in a separate section of Annex III;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>

      <p n="14">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The provisions of point 6 of Part C of the Annex shall enter into force six months after the date of such publication.</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
