      <p n="2">PROTOCOL to the 1979 Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution concerning the control of emissions of nitrogen oxides or their transboundary fluxes</p>
      <p n="3">THE PARTIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Determined to implement the Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution,</p>
      <p n="5">Concerned that present emissions of air pollutants are causing damage, in exposed parts of Europe and North America, to natural resources of vital environmental and economic importance,</p>
      <p n="6">Recalling that the executive body for the Convention recognized at its second session the need to reduce effectively the total annual emissions of nitrogen oxides from stationary and mobile sources or their transboundary fluxes by 1995, and the need on the part of other States that had already made progress in reducing these emissions to maintain and review their emission standards for nitrogen oxides,</p>
      <p n="7">Taking into consideration existing scientific and technical data on emissions, atmospheric movements and effects on the environment of nitrogen oxides and their secondary products, as well as on control technologies,</p>
      <p n="8">Conscious that the adverse environmental effects of emissions of nitrogen oxides vary among countries,</p>
      <p n="9">Determined to take effective action to control and reduce national annual emissions of nitrogen oxides or their transboundary fluxes by, in particular, the application of appropriate national emission standards to new mobile and major new stationary sources and the retrofitting of existing major stationary sources,</p>
      <p n="10">Recognizing that scientific and technical knowledge of these matters is developing and that it will be necessary to take such developments into account when reviewing the operation of this Protocol and deciding on further action,</p>
      <p n="11">Noting that the elaboration of an approach based on critical loads is aimed at the establishment of an effect-oriented scientific basis to be taken into account when reviewing the operation of this Protocol and at deciding on further internationally agreed measures to limit and reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides or their transboundary fluxes,</p>
      <p n="12">Recognizing that the expeditious consideration of procedures to create more favourable conditions for exchange of technology will contribute to the effective reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides in the region of the Commission,</p>
      <p n="13">Noting with appreciation the mutual commitment undertaken by several countries to implement immediate and substantial reductions of national annual emissions of nitrogen oxides,</p>

      <p n="117">In witness whereof the undersigned, being duly authorized thereto, have signed the present Protocol.</p>
      <p n="118">Done at Sofia this thirty-first day of October one thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight.</p>
      <p n="119">TECHNICAL ANNEX</p>
      <p n="120">1. Information regarding emission performance and costs is based on official documentation of the executive body and its subsidiary bodies, in particular documents EB.AIR/WG.3/R. 8, R. 9 and R. 16, and ENV/WP.1/R. 86, and Corr. 1, as reproduced in chapter 7 of Effects and Control of Transboundary Air Pollution (1). Unless otherwise indicated, the technologies listed are considered to be well established on the basis of operational experience (2).</p>
      <p n="121">2. The information contained in this Annex is incomplete. Because experience with new engines and new plants incorporating low emission technology, as well as with retrofitting existing plants, is continuously expanding, regular elaboration and amendment of the Annex will be necessary. The Annex cannot be an exhaustive statement of technical options; its aim is to provide guidance for the Parties in identifying economically feasible technologies for giving effect to the obligations of the Protocol.</p>
      <p n="122">I. CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES FOR NOx-EMISSIONS FROM STATIONARY SOURCES</p>
      <p n="123">3. Fossil fuel combustion is the main stationary source of anthropogenic NOx emissions. In addition, some non-combustion processes can contribute relevant NOx emissions.</p>
      <p n="124">4. Major stationary source categories of NOx emissions may include:</p>
      <p n="125">(a) combustion plants;</p>
      <p n="126">(b) industrial process furnaces (e.g., cement manufacture);</p>
      <p n="127">(c) stationary gas turbines and internal combustion engines; and</p>
      <p n="128">(d) non-combustion processes (e.g. nitric acid production).</p>
      <p n="129">5. Technologies for the reduction of NOx emissions focus on certain combustion/process modifications, and, especially for large power plants, on flue gas treatment.</p>
      <p n="130">6. For retrofitting of existing plants, the extent of application of low-NOx technologies may be limited by negative operational side-effects or by other site-specific constraints. In the case of retrofitting, therefore, only approximate estimates are given for typically achievable NOx emission values. For new plants, negative side-effects can be minimized or excluded by appropriate design features.</p>
      <p n="131">7. According to currently available data, the costs of combustion modifications can be considered as small for new plants. However, in the case of retrofitting for instance at large power plants, they ranged from about 8 to 25 Swiss francs per kWel (in 1985). As a rule, investment costs of flue gas treatment systems are considerably higher.</p>
      <p n="132">8. For stationary sources, emission factors are expressed in milligrams of NO2 per normal (0 °C, 1013 mb) cubic metre (mg/m³), dry basis.</p>
      <p n="133">Combustion plants</p>
      <p n="134">9. The category of combustion plants comprises fossil fuel combustion in furnaces, boilers, indirect heaters and other combustion facilities with a heat input larger than 10 MW, without mixing the combustion flue gases with other effluents or treated materials. The following combustion technologies, either singly or in combination, are available for new and existing installations:</p>
      <p n="135">(a) low-temperature design of the firebox, including fluidized bed combustion;</p>
      <p n="136">(b) low excess-air operation;</p>
      <p n="137">(c) installation of special low-NOx burners;</p>
      <p n="138">(d) flue gas recirculation into the combustion air;</p>
      <p n="139">(e) staged combustion/overfire-air operation; and</p>
      <p n="140">(f) reburning (fuel staging) (1).</p>
      <p n="141">Performance standards that can be achieved are summarized in Table 1.</p>
      <p n="142">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="143">10. Flue gas treatment by selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is an additional NOx emission reduction measure with efficiencies of up to 80 % and more. Considerable operational experience from new and retrofitted installations is now being obtained within the region of the Commission, in particular for power plants larger than 300 MW (thermal). When combined with combustion modifications, emission values of 200 mg/m³ (solid fuels, 6 % O2) and 150 mg/m³ (liquid fuels, 3 % O2) can be easily met.</p>
      <p n="144">11. Selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), a flue gas treatment for a 20 to 60 % NOx reduction, is a cheaper technology for special applications (e. g. refinery furnaces and base load gas combustion).</p>
      <p n="145">Stationary gas turbines and internal combustion (IC) engines</p>
      <p n="146">12. NOx emissions from stationary gas turbines can be reduced either by combustion modification (dry control) or by water/steam injection (wet control). Both measures are well established. By these means, emission values of 150 mg/m3 (gas, 15 % O2) and 300 mg/m3 (oil, 15 % O2) can be met. Retrofit is possible.</p>
      <p n="147">13. NOx emissions from stationary spark ignition IC engines can be reduced either by combustion modifications (e.g. lean-burn and exhaust gas recirculation concepts) or by flue gas treatment (closed-loop three-way catalytic converter, SCR). The technical and economic feasibility of these various processes depends on engine size, engine type (two-stroke/four-stroke), and engine operation mode (constant/varying load). The lean-burn concept is capable of meeting NOx emission values of 800 mg/m3 (5 % O2), the SCR process reduces NOx emissions well below 400 mg/m3 (5 % O2), and the three-way catalytic converter reduces such emissions even below 200 mg/m3 (5 % O2).</p>
      <p n="148">Industrial process furnaces - Cement calcination</p>
      <p n="149">14. The precalcination process is being evaluated within the region of the Commission as a possible technology with the potencial for reducing NOx concentrations in the flue gas of new and existing cement calcination furnaces to about 300 mg/m3 (10 % O2).</p>
      <p n="150">Non-combustion processes - Nitric acid production</p>
      <p n="151">15. Nitric acid production with a high pressure absorption (&gt;8 bar) is capable of keeping NOx concentrations in undiluted effluents below 400 m3. The same emission performance can be met by medium pressure absorption in combination with a SCR process or any other similar efficient NOx reduction process. Retrofit is possible.</p>
      <p n="152">II. CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES FOR NOX EMISSIONS FROM MOTOR VEHICLES</p>
      <p n="153">16. The motor vehicles considered in this Annex are those used for road transport, namely: petrol-fuelled and diesel-fuelled passenger cars, light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles. Appropriate reference is made, as necessary, to the specific vehicle categories (M1, M2, M3, N1, N2, N3) defined in EEC Regulation N° 13 pursuant to the 1958 Agreement concerning the adoption of uniform conditions of approval and reciprocal recognition of approval for motor vehicles equipment and parts.</p>
      <p n="154">17. Road transport is a major source of anthropogenic NOx emission in many Commission countries, contributing between 40 and 80 % of total national emissions. Typically, petrol-fuelled vehicles contribute two-thirds of total road transport NOx emissions.</p>
      <p n="155">18. The technologies available for the control of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles are summarized in Tables 3 and 6. It is convenient to group the technologies by reference to existing or proposed national and international emission standards differing in stringency of control. Because current regulatory test cycles only reflect urban and metropolitan driving, the estimates of relative NOx emissions given below take account of higher speed driving where NOx emissions can be particularly important.</p>
      <p n="156">19. The additional production cost figures for the various technologies given in Tables 3 and 6 are manufacturing cost estimates rather than retail prices.</p>
      <p n="157">20. Control of production conformity and in-use vehicle performance is important in ensuring that the reduction potential of emission standards is achieved in practice.</p>
      <p n="158">21. Technologies that incorporate or are based on the use of catalytic converters require unleaded fuel. Free circulation of vehicles equipped with catalytic converters depends on the general availability of unleaded petrol.</p>

      <p n="160">22. In Table 2, four emission standards are summarized. These are used in Table 3 to group the various engine technologies for petrol vehicles according to their NOx emission reduction potential.</p>

      <p n="162">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="163">23. The emission standards A, B, C and D include limits on hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions as well as NOx. Estimates of emission reductions for these pollutants, relative to the baseline ECE R. 15-04 case, are given in Table 4.</p>
      <p n="164">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="165">24. Current diesel cars can meet the NOx emission requirements of standards A, B and C. Strict particulate emission requirements, together with the stringent NOx limits of standard D, imply that diesel passenger cars will require further development, probably including electronic control of the fuel pump, advanced fuel injection systems, exhaust gas recirculation and particulate traps. Only experimental vehicles exist to date. (See also Table 6, footnote (a)).</p>
      <p n="166">Other light-duty vehicles (N1)</p>
      <p n="167">25. The control methods for passenger cars are applicable but NOx reductions, costs and commercial lead time factors may differ.</p>
      <p n="168">Heavy-duty petrol-fuelled vehicles (M2, M3, N2, N3)</p>
      <p n="169">26. This class of vehicle is insignificant in western Europe and is decreasing in eastern Europe. US 1990 and US 1991 NOx emission levels (see Table 5) could be achieved at modest cost without significant technology advancement.</p>
      <p n="170">Heavy-duty diesel-fuelled vehicles (M2, M3, N2, N3)</p>
      <p n="171">27. In Table 5, three emission standards are summarized. These are used in Table 6 to group engine technologies for heavy-duty diesel vehicles according to NOx reduction potential. The baseline engine configuration is changing, with a trend away from naturally aspirated to turbo-charged engines. This trend has implications for improved baseline fuel consumption performance. Comparative estimates of consumption are therefore not included.</p>

      <p n="175">(2) It is at present difficult to provide reliable data on the costs of control technologies in absolute terms. For cost data included in the present Annex, emphasis should therefore be placed on the relationship between the costs of different technologies rather than on absolute cost figures.</p>
      <p n="176">(3) There is limited operational experience of this type of combustion technology.</p>
