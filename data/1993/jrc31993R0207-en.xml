      <p n="6">Whereas for the purposes of Article 5 (3) (b) and (c) and (4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation`), exhaustive lists have to be established in Sections A, B and C of Annex VI thereto;</p>

      <p n="8">Whereas any ingredients or processing aids to be mentioned in Annex VI to the Regulation should be used only in accordance with legislative requirements concerning the preparation of foodstuffs and according to good practice of in the manufacturing of foodstuffs;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Annex VI to the Regulation should take account of consumers' expect actions that processed products from organic production will be composed essentially of ingredients as they occur in nature;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, however, other ingredients or processing aids which may be used in conventionally processed foodstuffs, and which preferably exist in nature, may be included in Annex VI to the Regulation, provided it has been shown that, without having recourse to such substances, it is impossible to produce or preserve organic foodstuffs;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, with regard to enzymes derived from micro-organisms, it has to be further examined whether such products obtained from micro-organisms genetically modified within the meaning of Council Directive 90/220/EEC (2), can be used in foodstuffs whose labelling refers to organic production methods; whereas this question will be examined in detail when such enzymes are approved for use in foodstuffs according to the relevant Community legislation;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the said Annex VI will have to be reviewed regularly in the light of experience gained and of developments with in the availability on the Community market of certain organically produced ingredients of agricultural origin;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas detailed rules for the implementation of the derogation pursuant to Article 5 (4) of the Regulation are necessary to ensure coherent implementation of this derogation in the Member States, as long as products covered by this derogation have not been included in Section C of Annex VI to the Regulation;</p>

      <p n="20">(a) for food additives covered by Section A, point 1 of Annex VI: without prejudice to the requirements for acceptance of additives provided for in Council Directive 89/107/EEC (3) only substances shall be included for which it has been shown that, without having recourse to such substances, it is impossible to produce or preserve such foodstuffs;</p>
      <p n="21">(b) for processing aids covered by Part B of Annex VI: only substances are included which are accepted in general food processing and for which it has been shown that, without having recourse to such substances, it is impossible to produce such foodstuffs.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 3</p>
      <p n="23">1. As long as an ingredient of agricultural origin has not been included in Section C of Annex VI to the Regulation, that ingredient may be used according to the derogation provided for in Article 5 (4) of that Regulation on the following conditions:</p>
      <p n="24">(a) that the operator has notified to the competent authority of the Member State all the requisite evidence showing that the ingredient concerned satisfies Article 5 (4); and</p>
      <p n="25">(b) that the competent authority of the Member State has authorized the use for a maximum period of three months, which may be reduced if it appears that supplies of the ingredient concerned are available in the Community.</p>
