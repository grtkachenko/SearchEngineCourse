      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 of 14 July 1992 on certificates of specific character for agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, in order to ensure that Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 is applied uniformly, precise deadlines should be set for the registration procedure;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, in order to take account of differences in legal situation in the Member States, a statement of objection within the meaning of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 presented by a group of individuals linked by a common interest may be admissible;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, in order for the Commission to be able to define the Community symbol and the indication provided for in Articles 12 and 15 respectively of Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92, the necessary information should be gathered in order for an evaluation to be made;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas these arrangements constitute a new Community system in response to requests from consumers for information about specific traditional products; whereas it is essential to explain the meaning of the Community symbol and the indication to the public, without thereby removing the need for producers and/or processors to promote their respective products;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 does not rule out the existence of national systems of certification for agricultural products and foodstuffs; whereas the use, where appropriate, of a national symbol in conjunction with the Community symbol should be permitted in the labelling, presentation and avertising of such products;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee on Certificates of Specific Character,</p>

      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
      <p n="24">Where national law treats a group of individuals without legal personality as a legal person, the said group of individuals shall be authorized to consult the application within the meaning and subject to the conditions of Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 and to lodge an objection within the meaning and subject to the conditions of Article 8 (3) of that Regulation.</p>

      <p n="27">2. For a period of five years following the date of entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall take the necessary steps to inform the public of the meaning of the indication and of the Community symbol. Such steps shall not take the form of aid to producers and/or processors.</p>
      <p n="28">Article 5</p>
      <p n="29">The simultaneous use of the Community symbol and national symbols shall be authorized for agricultural products and foodstuffs which satisfy both the requirements of Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 and national requirements to which those products or foodstuffs correspond.</p>
      <p n="30">Article 6</p>
      <p n="31">Subsequent to the registration provided for in Article 9 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92, the competent authorities shall ensure that any individual may consult the specificaiton of the agricultural product or foodstuff which has been so registered.</p>
      <p n="32">Article 7</p>
