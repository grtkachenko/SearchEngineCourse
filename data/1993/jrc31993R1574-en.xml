      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1574/93 of 14 June 1993 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 on the common organization of the market in eggs, Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat, Regulation (EEC) No 827/68 on the common organization of the market in certain products listed in Annex II to the EEC Treaty and Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and the Common Customs Tariff</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>

      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas it has recently been detected that classification of certain egg products falling within CN code 0408 in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (4) creates problems for the competent authorities; whereas to remedy that situation the structure of the subheadings falling within CN code 0408 should be improved;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas Regulations (EEC) No 2771/75 (5), and (EEC) No 2777/75 (6), have not provided up to the present for a system of import licences; whereas in view of the increasing number of international agreements concerning inter alia trade in eggs and poultrymeat such a system involving the provision of security as a guarantee that importation will be effected should be introduced in these sectors too in order that a check may be kept on the volume of imports;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides for refunds on exports to third countries of eggs and egg products also in the form of further processed products listed in the Annex thereto; whereas in order to facilitate future amendments to this list, it should be adopted in accordance with Article 17 of the said Regulation;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas prepared goose or duck livers falling within CN code 1602 20 10 are covered by Regulation (EEC) No 827/68 (7); whereas these preparations should be brought under Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 in order to be able to lay down common marketing standards for these products necessary for ensuring harmonized information of consumers and fair competition; whereas the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 827/68 should be adapted accordingly,</p>
