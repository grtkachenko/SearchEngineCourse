      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 717/93 of 26 March 1993 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3076/78 on the importation of hops from non-member countries</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of 26 June 1971 on the common organization of the market in hops (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3124/92 (2), and in particular Article 5 (3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, pursuant to Article 1 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3076/78 of 21 December 1978 on the importation of hops from non-member countries (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2940/92 (4), hops imported from non-member countries must be accompanied by an attestation of equivalence; whereas a temporary derogation - in the form of a control attestation - is given to certain countries not listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3077/78 of 21 December 1978 on the equivalence with Community certificates of attestations accompanying hops imported from non-member countries (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2238/91 (6); whereas these control attestations provide only very little information as regards the characteristics of the product and no information at all on its origin and year of harvest; whereas, therefore, provision should be made for hops imported with a control attestation and hop products prepared from such hops not to be covered by a certification procedure;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Hops,</p>
      <p n="8">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="9">Article 1</p>
      <p n="10">The following subparagraph is added to Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3076/78:</p>
      <p n="11">'Hops imported with a control attestation and hop products prepared from hops imported with such an attestation may not be covered by a certification procedure.`</p>
      <p n="12">Article 2</p>
      <p n="13">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="14">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="15">Done at Brussels, 26 March 1993.</p>
