      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 77/93/EEC of 21 December 1976 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), as last amended by Directive 93/19/EEC (2), and in particular Article 14 (3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the requests made by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and the Netherlands,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, under the provisions of Directive 77/93/EEC, oak (Quercus L.) logs with bark attached, originating in Canada or the United States of America, may, in principle, not be introduced into the Community because of the risk of introducing Ceratocystis fagacearum (Bretz) Hunt., the cause of oak wilt;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the Commission has established, on the basis of the information available at present, that, in respect of both Canada and the United Statets of America, the risk of spreading Cetocystis fagacearum (Bretz) Hunt is obviated provided that special conditions are satisfied;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, however the seasonal shipment facilities for oak wood belonging to the white oak group are justified only in those parts of the Community where potential vectors of Ceratocystis fagacearum (Bretz) Hunt have little or no activity during the winter, i.e. in areas north of 45Â° latitude;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the Commission will ensure that Canada and the United States of America make available all technical information necessary to monitor the functioning of the protective measures required under the aforementioned technical conditions;</p>

The pile shall undergo fumigation with pure methyl bromide which is carried out at a minimum rate of 240 g/m3 of total volume under cover for 72 hours and at an initial temperature of the logs of + 5 Â°C at least, and which meets any additional requirement set up by the official plant protection organization of either Canada (i.e. 'Agricultural Canada') or the United States of America (i.e. 'Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service' - APHIS). After 24 hours of treatment, an addition of gas shall be made to regain the aforementioned concentration; the temperature of the logs shall be maintained at + 3 Â°C, at least, throughout the procedure. It may be decided, based on scientific evidence and in accordance with the procedure laid down in</p>
      <p n="86">Article 16a of Directive 77/93/EEC, that other schedules shall or may be used.</p>

      <p n="90">The sales at which the licensed operatives shall carry out the fumigation procedures shall preferably be located at the ports of shipment to the Community, but selected inland sites may be approved by the official plant protection organization concerned.</p>
      <p n="91">4. A fumigation batch identification mark (digits and/or letters) shall be placed in a non-removable manner on the base end of each log of the pile undergoing fumigation. The fumigation batch identification mark shall be reserved to the shipper. It shall not have been used for logs of other batches. Records of the identification marks shall be kept by the licensed fumigation operatives.</p>
      <p n="92">5. The individual fumigation procedure including the marking referred to in 4 shall systematically be supervised at the fumigation sites, directly by officials of the official plant protection organization concerned or by cooperating State/province officials in such a way as to guarantee compliance with the requirements laid down in 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p>
      <p n="93">6. The official phytosanitary certificate required pursuant to Article 12 (1) (b) of Directive 77/93/EEC shall be issued by the official plant protection organization concerned after finalization of the fumigation, and be based on the actions mentioned in 5 and the examination carried out in accordance with Article 6 of the said Directive relating to the conditions laid down in Article 6 (1) (a) of that Directive and in this Annex.</p>

      <p n="97">ANNEX II</p>
      <p n="98">PROVISIONS FOR A FUMIGATION COLOUR REACTION TEST The fumigation colour reaction test referred to in Article 1 (2) (d) third indent shall be performed as follows:</p>
      <p n="99">Samples of the entire sapwood thickness shall be taken with an increment borer from areas with intact bark at least one metre from the log ends and soaked in a freshly prepared (less than one day old) 1 % solution of 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) made with distilled water. Samples which show no red coloration after three days soaking are considered as having been adequately fumigated.</p>
      <p n="100">ANNEX III</p>
      <p n="101">PROVISIONS IN RESPECT OF WHITE OAK LOG IDENTIFICATION 1. Officials of the official plant protection organization concerned shall have identified each log as belonging to the white oak group either by visual means, as far as possible, or by carrying out white oak log identification colour tests as specified in 2. This identification colour test shall be performed on at least 10 % of the logs per consignment.</p>
      <p n="102">2. The white oak log identification colour test shall be carried out by means of spraying or painting 10 % sodium nitrite solution to an area of clean superficially dried heartwood at least five centimetres in diameter. Evaluation of the test shall be done within 20 to 60 minutes of application. At temperatures below 2,5 Â°C, 20 % ethylene glycol can be added to the solution as an antifreeze agent. Samples of logs in which the natural colour initially turns reddish brown becoming black to grey blue in later stages are considered as belonging to the white oak group.</p>
      <p n="103">3. Each log shall be marked 'WO', under the supervision of the official plant protection organization concerned or cooperating State/province officials.</p>
      <p n="104">4. The official phytosanitary certificate required pursuant to Article 12 (1) (b) of Directive 77/93/EEC shall be issued by the official plant protection organization concerned, and be based on the actions mentioned in 1, 2 and 3. The certificate shall indicate the botanical name of the genus or the species and the number of logs in the consignment. It shall bear the following 'Additional Declaration':</p>
      <p n="105">'It is hereby certified that the logs shipped under this certificate belong solely to species of the white oak group.'</p>
