      <p n="2">COMMISSION DECISION of 2 February 1993 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for the re-entry of registered horses for racing, competition and cultural events after temporary export</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae(1) , as last amended by Directive 92/36/EEC(2) , and in particular Article 19 (ii) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas by Council Decision 79/542/EEC(3) , as last amended by Commission Decision 93/100/EEC(4) , the list of third countries from which the Member States authorize imports of equidae in particular has been established;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas it is also necessary to take into account the regionalization of certain third countries appearing on the abovementioned list, which is the subject of Commission Decision 92/160/EEC(5) , as amended by Decision 92/161/EEC(6) ;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the national veterinary authorities have undertaken to notify the Commission and the Member States, by telegram, telex or telefax, within 24 hours of the confirmation of the occurrence of any infectious or contagious disease in equidae of lists A and B of the International Office of Epizootics (IOE) or of the adoption of vaccination against any of them or, within an appropriate period, of any proposed changes in the national import rules concerning equidae;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the different categories of horses have their own features and their imports are authorized for different purposes; whereas, consequently, specific health requirements must be established for the re-entry of registered horses for racing, competition and cultural events after temporary export;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, given the existence of equivalent health situations at racecourses and on premises where competitions or cultural events are held, and given the isolation from equidae of lower health status, it seems advisable to establish a single health certificate for re-entry of registered horses for racing, competition and cultural events after temporary export to third countries;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">Without prejudice to Decision 92/160/EEC Member States shall authorize the re-entry of registered horses for racing, competition and cultural events after temporary export of not more than 30 days such horses:</p>
      <p n="15">- return from third countries appearing in Parts I and II of the special column for equidae in the Annex to Decision 79/542/EEC to which they have been temporarily exported either directly of after transit through other countries of the same group in Annex I to the present Decision,</p>
      <p n="16">- comply with the requirements laid down in the specimen animal health certificate set out in Annex II to the present Decision.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
