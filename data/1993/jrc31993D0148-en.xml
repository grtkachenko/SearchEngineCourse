      <p n="6">Whereas Commission Decision 81/526/EEC (3), as amended by Decision 83/70/EEC (4), lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification of imports of fresh meat from Switzerland, and whereas such imports of fresh meat originate from Swiss animals;</p>

      <p n="10">Whereas it is necessary to amend Decision 81/526/EEC accordingly and, in particular, to lay down a supplementary attestation ensuring that the fresh meat imported from Switzerland satisfies the requirements of Directive 72/462/EEC;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
