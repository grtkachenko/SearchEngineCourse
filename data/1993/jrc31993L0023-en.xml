      <p n="8">Whereas provision should be made for those Member States whose pig population makes up only a small percentage of the overall population of the Community to reduce the number of annual surveys where appropriate;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in order to ensure that the common agricultural policy is properly administered, particularly where the pigmeat market is concerned, the Commission requires regular data on trends in livestock and in pigmeat production;</p>

      <p n="11">Whereas, in order to facilitate implementation of this Directive, close cooperation is necessary between the Member States and the Commission and this should be effected in particular via the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics set up by Decision 72/279/EEC(4) ,</p>
