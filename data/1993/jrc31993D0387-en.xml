      <p n="3">(93/387/EEC)THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 91/492/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas a visiting group of Commission experts has conducted an inspection in Morocco to verify the conditions under which live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods are produced and placed on the market;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Moroccan legislation makes veterinary inspectors, assisted by technical assistants from the Direction de l'élevage (Animal Husbandry Directorate) of the Ministry for Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, responsible for inspecting the health of live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods and monitoring the hygiene and sanitary conditions of production; whereas the same legislation empowers the Ministry of Fisheries to authorize or prohibit the harvesting of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods from certain zones on the basis of a report from the animal Husbandry Directorate and the Scientific Institute for Maritime Fisheries;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas provision is made under prevailing Moroccan legislation for the systematic inspection for biotoxins of live bivalve molluscs placed on the market;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the Animal Husbandry Directorate and its laboratories are capable of monitoring efficiently the application of the laws in force in Morocco;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the competent Moroccan authorities have undertaken to communicate regularly and quickly to the Commission data on the presence of plankton containing toxins in the harvest zones;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the competent Moroccan authorities have given official assurances regarding compliance with the requirements specified in Chapter V of the Annex to Directive 91/492/EEC and compliance with requirements equivalent to those set out in that Directive for the classification of production zones and relaying zones, for the approval of centres for dispatch and purification, and for public health control and production monitoring; whereas in particular any possible change in harvesting zones will be communicated to the Community;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas Morocco is eligible for inclusion in the list, referred to in Article 9 (3) (a) of Directive 91/492/EEC, showing the third countries fulfilling the conditions of equivalence;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the procedure for obtaining a health certificate referred to in Article 9 (3) (b) (i) of the aforesaid Directive must entail the definition of a model certificate, the language(s) in which it must be drawn up, the formal capacity of the signatory and the health mark to be affixed to the packaging;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, in accordance with Article 9 (3) (b) (ii) of the aforesaid Directive, the production areas from which bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods may be harvested and exported to the Community must be defined;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas, in accordance with Article 9 (3) (c) of the aforesaid Directive, a list of the establishments from which the importation of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods is authorized should be established; whereas such establishments may appear on the list only if they are officially approved by the competent Moroccan authorities; whereas it is the duty of the competent Moroccan authorities to ensure that the requirements laid down to that end in that provision are complied with;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas the special import conditions apply without prejudice to decisions taken pursuant to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products (2);</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
