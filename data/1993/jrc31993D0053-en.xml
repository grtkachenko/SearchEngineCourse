      <p n="3">(93/53/EEC)THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Whereas within the framework of Community protection of designations of origin and geographical indications, registration thereof may involve examining problems concerning the generic nature of a name and the factors to be taken into account when defining the designation of origin and geographical indication for agricultural products and foodstuffs, on the one hand, and the application of criteria regarding fair competition in commercial transactions and the danger of confusing consumers within the meaning of Articles 13 and 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 (1) in cases where there is a conflict between the designation of origin or geographical indication and the trademark, homonyms or existing products which are legally marketed, on the other hand;</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas within the framework of Community protection of certificates of specific character, registration thereof may involve examining problems concerning assessment of the traditional nature of agricultural products and foodstuffs;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the search for solutions to such problems requires the assistance of highly qualified experts with legal or agricultural backgrounds, and particularly with knowledge of intellectual property rights;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas it is therefore appropriate to set up a scientific committee to assist the Commission,</p>

      <p n="15">2. generic nature;</p>
      <p n="16">3. the assessment of traditional nature;</p>

      <p n="29">2. Upon the expiry of the period of five years or two years, as the case may be, the members, Chairman and Vice-chairman shall remain in office until they are replaced or their appointments are renewed.</p>

      <p n="32">1. The Committee shall meet at the request of a representative of the Commission.</p>
