      <p n="2">COMMISSION DECISION of 5 February 1993 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of equidae for slaughter</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae(1) , as last amended by Directive 92/361/EEC(2) , and in particular Article 15 point (a),</p>
      <p n="6">Articles 16 and 18 thereof;</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC(3) , as last amended by Decision 92/438/EEC(4) , and in particular Article 4 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas by Council Decision 79/542/EEC(5) , as last amended by Commission Decision 93/100/EEC(6) , the list of third countries from which the Member States authorize imports of equidae in particular has been established;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas it is also necessary to take into account the regionalization of certain third countries appearing on the abovementioned list, which is the subject of Commission Decision 92/160/EEC(7) , as amended by Decision 92/161/EEC(8) ;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the responsible national veterinary authorities have undertaken to notify the Commission and the Member States, by telegram, telex or telefax, within 24 hours of the confirmation of the occurrence of any infectious or contagious disease in equidae of lists A and B of the International Office of Epizootic Diseases or of the adoption of vaccination against any of them or, within an appropriate period, of any changes in the national import rules concerning equidae;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the conditions to be established for imports of equidae for slaughter apply without prejudice to the requirements of Council Directive 86/469/EEC(9) that no thyreostatic, estrogenic, androgenic or gestagenic substances are used for fattening purposes in equidae;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the certification for a consignment of equidae for slaughter has been provided for, provided the animals are properly marked and identified; whereas therefore it is necessary to establish a clear and indelible mark for equidae for slaughter;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the different categories of equidae have their own features and their imports are authorized for different purposes; whereas, consequently different health requirements must be established for equidae for slaughter being sent directly to the slaughterhouse of destination and, for equidae for slaughter, passing through a market or a marshalling centre;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">Without prejudice to Decision 92/160/EEC, Member States shall authorize imports of equidae for slaughter from a third country appearing in Part I of the Annex to Decision 79/542/EEC and which are clearly and indelibly marked by a hot-branded 'S' of not less than 3 cm size on the hoof of the left front leg and</p>
      <p n="18">(i) which, if sent directly to a slaughterhouse to be slaughtered within five days after arrival at the slaughterhouse and not more than five days after arrival in the Community, meet the requirements of Annex I of the present Decision. However, where equidae are subjected to a sea-voyage of more than eight days, Member States may decide that such equidae may be slaughtered within 21 days of arrival at the slaughterhouse, provided they remain at the slaughterhouse under the daily supervision of the official veterinarian. Member States shall notify the Commission of such cases; or</p>
      <p n="19">(ii) which, if they are passing through a market or a marshalling centre before being slaughtered, meet the requirements of Annex II.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
