      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 3533/93 of 21 December 1993 amending Regulations (EEC) No 3444/90, (EEC) No 3445/90 and (EEC) No 3446/90, laying down detailed rules for granting private storage aid for pigmeat, beef and veal, and sheepmeat and goatmeat</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1249/89 (2), and in particular Article 7 (2) and the second subparagraph of Article 22 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 747/93 (4), and in particular Articles 8 (2) and 25 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 363/93 (6), and in particular Article 7 (5) and the second paragraph of Article 28 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (7), and in particular Article 6 (2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas there is some ambiguity in the current texts of Commission Regulations (EEC) No 3444/90 (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3792/90 (9), (EEC) No 3445/90 (10) and (EEC) No 3446/90 (11), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1258/91 (12), as regards the penalty to be imposed in the event that the time limit for placing in storage is exceeded; whereas therefore it is necessary to clarify the text on this point;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 introduces new agrimonetary arrangements as from 1 January 1993; whereas, under those arrangements, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 of 30 April 1993 on detailed rules for determining and applying the agricultural conversion rates (13) establishes the operative events for the agricultural conversion rates; whereas, therefore, it is necessary to establish the operative event for private storage in the pigmeat sector, provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3444/90, in the beef and veal sector provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3445/90 and in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector, provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3446/90;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas experience has shown that in certain circumstances, and in particular where excessive use is made of the private-storage aid scheme, there is a risk of abuse in applying it;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, therefore, decisions on applications to conclude contracts should be notified only after a period for reflection has elapsed; whereas that period must allow the market situation to be assessed and permit provision to be made, where appropriate, for special measures applying in particular to applications pending; whereas, in order to be able to administer this system, the Commission must have information about the quantities of products for which applications to conclude contracts have been submitted;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committees for Pigmeat, Beef and Veal and Sheepmeat and Goatmeat,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>

      <p n="27">Where an examination of the situation reveals that excessive use has been made of the scheme introduced by this Regulation, or if there is a risk of excessive use, such measures may include:</p>
