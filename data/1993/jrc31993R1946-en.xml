      <p n="8">Whereas the Treaty of 22 July 1975, amending certain financial provisions of the Treaties establishing the European Communities and of the Treaty establishing a single Council and a single Commission of the European Communities, modified the procedure for giving a discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities; whereas therefore it is appropriate to update the procedure for giving a discharge to the Management Board of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, set up by Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 (4) by reference to the procedure so modified, as set out in Article 206b of the EEC Treaty;</p>

      <p n="11">Whereas it is desirable to provide for the transmission of the annual general report on the Centre to all interested Community bodies;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 should therefore be amended;</p>
