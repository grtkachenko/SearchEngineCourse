      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 1999/26/EC</p>
      <p n="3">of 20 April 1999</p>
      <p n="4">adapting to technical progress Council Directive 93/94/EEC relating to the space for mounting the rear registration plate of two or three-wheel motor vehicles</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles(1), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Article 16 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 93/94/EEC of 29 October 1993 relating to the space for mounting the rear registration plate of two or three-wheel motor vehicles(2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Whereas Directive 93/94/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the Community type-approval procedure introduced by Directive 92/61/EEC; whereas the provisions of Directive 92/61/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and technical units therefore apply to that Directive;</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Whereas developments in technology now permit an adaptation of Council Directive 93/94/EEC to technical progress; whereas in order to ensure the proper functioning of the type-approval system as a whole, it is therefore necessary to clarify or complete certain provisions of the Directive concerned;</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Whereas to this end it is necessary to adapt the provisions relating to the load conditions of vehicles when measuring the inclination and those relating to the dimensions of spaces for mounting the rear registration plate of quadricycles fitted with a body as well as to align Figure 1 on the actual position of vehicles during tests and to better specify certain references in the information document;</p>
      <p n="13">(4) Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress set up by Article 13 of Council Directive 70/156/EEC(3), as last amended by Directive 98/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(4),</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>

      <p n="19">- refuse, in respect of a type of two or three-wheel vehicle, to grant EC type-approval,</p>
      <p n="20">- prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of two or three-wheel motor vehicles,</p>
      <p n="21">if the space for mounting the rear registration plate complies with the requirements of Directive 93/94/EEC as amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="22">2. With effect from 1 July 2000, Member States shall refuse to grant EC type-approval for any type of two or three-wheel motor vehicle on grounds relating to the space for mounting the rear registration plate if the requirements of Directive 93/94/EEC, as amended by this Directive, are not fulfilled.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
      <p n="24">1. Member States shall adopt and publish, no later than 31 December 1999, the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="25">They shall apply those provisions from 1 January 2000.</p>
      <p n="26">When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.</p>
      <p n="27">2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law that they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="28">Article 4</p>
