These provisions are to apply from 1 January 2000.</p>

      <p n="17">"4. For the purposes of this Regulation:</p>
      <p n="18">(a) 'skimmed milk' means the milk of one or more cows or goats to which nothing has been added and which has been only partially skimmed so as to reduce its fat content to no more than 0,10 %;</p>
      <p n="19">(b) 'raw casein' means products, insoluble in water, obtained from skimmed milk by precipitation through microbial acidification or the addition of acids, rennet or other milk-coagulating enzymes, regardless of any prior use of ion exchange or concentration processes;</p>
      <p n="20">(c) 'casein' means washed and dried products, insoluble in water and obtained from raw casein or skimmed milk by precipitation through microbial acidification or the addition of acids, rennet or other milk-coagulating enzymes, regardless of any prior use of ion exchange or concentration processes;</p>

      <p n="22">Article 2</p>
      <p n="23">This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2000.</p>
      <p n="24">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
