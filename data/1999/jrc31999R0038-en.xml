      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 38/1999 of 8 January 1999 supplementing the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 on the entry of certain names in the "Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications" provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 38/1999 of 8 January 1999 supplementing the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 on the entry of certain names in the 'Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications` provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1068/97 (2), and in particular Article 7(5)(b) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas, pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92, France sent the Commission an application for registration of a name as a designation of origin;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, pursuant to Article 6(1) thereof, the application was found to comply with that Regulation, and in particular to contain all the information required pursuant to Article 4 thereof;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas a statement of objection was received by the Commission pursuant to Article 7 of that Regulation following publication of the name in the Annex hereto in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3); whereas that objection was considered to be properly founded and therefore admissible;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas pursuant to Article 7(5) of that Regulation the Commission asked the Member States concerned to seek an agreement; whereas no agreement was reached and it is therefore up to the Commission to take a decision on registration of the name in question;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the Commission has carefully considered the actual likelihood of confusion;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas it emerges that there is in fact no likelihood of confusion between the name Rocamadour and the product so designated and the name Romadur and the product so designated; whereas although both products are cheeses they are easy to differentiate by external appearance and type; whereas Rocamadour is a small very soft goat's milk cheese with a natural rind consisting of a striated, slightly velvety skin, is white to cream in colour and takes the form of a small thin disc weighing roughly 35 grams; whereas Romadur is a soft cow's milk cheese with a yellow brown to reddish skin and generally takes the form of a rectangle or cube weighing 80 to 180 grams;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the name Romadur can therefore continue to be used;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the name 'Rocamadour` should therefore be entered in the 'Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications` as a designation of origin protected at Community level;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas the Annex hereto supplements the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2784/98 (5);</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">The name in the Annex hereto is hereby added to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 and entered in the 'Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications` provided for in Article 6(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 as a protected designation of origin (PDO).</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="22">Done at Brussels, 8 January 1999.</p>
