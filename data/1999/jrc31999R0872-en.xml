      <p n="12">(5) Whereas the name should therefore be entered in the "Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications" and hence be protected throughout the Community as a protected designation of origin;</p>

      <p n="47">4.1. Name: Exmoor Blue Cheese</p>
      <p n="48">4.2. Description: Full-fat blue-veined soft cheese with an average fat content of 34 %. Typified by a rich yellow colour and buttery texture. Made from unpasteurised Jersey cows' milk.</p>
      <p n="49">4.3. Geographical area: That part of the counties of Devon and Somerset from Barnstaple along the coast to the town of Watchet, the steam railway line from Watchet until it is crossed by road B 3227, road B 3227 west until it crosses road A 361, road A 361 west into Barnstaple.</p>
      <p n="50">4.4. Proof of origin: The cheese has been produced using traditional hand methods on the applicant's farm since 1986. From 1990, milk solely from the Jersey breed of cow has been used to make this distinctive soft cheese.</p>
      <p n="51">4.5. Method of production: Milk is heated to 70° F and starter is added. The milk is then heated to 85 to 90° F and this temperature is held for three to five hours. Vegetarian rennet and Penicillium roqueforti are added during this period. The curd is allowed to set before being cut and transferred with hand-strainers to two part moulds and left to drain. After both six and 18 hours the moulds are turned. Twenty-four hours later the cheeses are put into a solution of brine for approximately six hours, then left to drain for a further 36 hours, during which time they are turned twice. After needling of both faces by hand, the cheeses are transferred to the maturing room and sprayed on both sides with Penicillium candidum. Exmoor Jersey Blue is left to mature for three to six weeks and turned every other day.</p>
      <p n="52">4.6. Link: The warm wet climate and the red topsoil derived from the underlying old and new red sandstone combine over a long grazing season to give lush pasture, which produces richly flavoured milk.</p>
      <p n="53">4.7. Inspection structure: Name: Specialist Cheese Makers Association</p>
      <p n="54">Address: PO Box 256A, Thames Ditton, Surrey KT7 0HR</p>
