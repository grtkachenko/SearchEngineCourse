      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1268/1999</p>
      <p n="3">of 21 June 1999</p>
      <p n="4">on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(4),</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Whereas the conclusions of the European Council of 12 and 13 December 1997 provide for an enhanced pre-accession strategy for the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe and a specific pre-accession strategy for Cyprus;</p>
      <p n="12">(2) Whereas the conclusions of the European Council provide that the aid provided for in this Regulation be granted for the time being to the 10 applicant countries of central and eastern Europe;</p>
      <p n="13">(3) Whereas the Community has decided to provide special assistance in the form of pre-accession aid for the countries applying for accession in order to carry out action to support the current economic and social reform process in those countries and to prepare and facilitate the integration of their economies into the Community economy;</p>
      <p n="14">(4) Whereas assistance from the Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period together with assistance from the Community under Council Regulation 1267/1999 of 21 June 1999 establishing an Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession(5) should be coordinated within the framework of Council Regulation 1266/1999 of 21 June 1999 on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89(6) and be subject to the conditional provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 622/98 of 16 March 1998 on assistance to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy, and in particular on the establishment of Accession Partnerships(7);</p>
      <p n="15">(5) Whereas paragraph 17 of the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council of 12 and 13 December 1997 provides that financial support to the countries involved in the enlargement process will be based, in the allocation of aid, on the principle of equal treatment, independently of the time of accession, with particular attention being paid to countries with the greatest need;</p>
      <p n="16">(6) Whereas the Community pre-accession aid has to be decided in particular to resolve priority problems in adapting the economies of the applicant countries in a sustainable manner and facilitating the implementation by them of the acquis communautaire, focusing in particular on the common agricultural policy (CAP);</p>
      <p n="17">(7) Whereas pre-accession aid for agriculture should follow the priorities of the reformed CAP; whereas such aid should be applied to priority areas to be defined for each country, such as the improvement of structures for processing agricultural and fishery products, distribution, quality control of food as well as veterinary and plant-health controls and the setting-up of producer groups; whereas it should also be possible to finance integrated rural development projects to support local initiatives and agri-environmental measures, to improve the efficiency of farms, to adapt infrastructure as well as measures which will accelerate structural reconversion;</p>
      <p n="18">(8) Whereas, in the agricultural sector, the Community support will be implemented in the form of multiannual programmes established in accordance with the guidelines and the principles of the operational programmes applied in the framework of structural policy in order to facilitate in the applicant countries the implementation of the principles and procedures in force;</p>
      <p n="19">(9) Whereas, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(8), assistance can only be granted for any measure from one Community financial instrument within a given period, subject in the case of the European Investment Bank (EIB) to its own rules on the provision of assistance;</p>
      <p n="20">(10) Whereas Community funds should not replace funding available in each applicant country and whereas Community assistance constitutes a financial contribution to the completion of projects;</p>
      <p n="21">(11) Whereas pre-accession aid in the agricultural sector has to be granted in the form of a financial contribution and subject to the specific financial rules established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(9);</p>
      <p n="22">(12) Whereas the allocation to applicant countries of resources fixed by the budget authority in the preamble of this instrument should take full account of national prosperity on the basis of gross domestic product, of the agricultural workforce, of utilised agricultural area and, if necessary, of specific territorial particularities;</p>
      <p n="23">(13) Whereas applicant countries should submit their plans as quickly as possible in order to avoid delaying the implementation of the pre-accession measures from 1 January 2000;</p>
      <p n="24">(14) Whereas the drawing-up of those programmes, their implementation and the follow-up mechanisms should comply with the specific Structural Fund rules and thus facilitate the transfer of the acquis communautaire;</p>
      <p n="25">(15) Whereas a detailed ex-ante assessment should be carried out before Community resources are commited in order to ensure that the programme complies with real needs, to permit flexibility in the implementation of Community intervention to take account of the relevant information and the first results of the measures, and to strengthen the monitoring and ex-post evaluation to ensure the effectiveness of the anticipated impact;</p>
      <p n="26">(16) Whereas provision should be made for a monitoring committee to assist the Commission with the follow-up to each programme;</p>
      <p n="27">(17) Whereas the necessary decisions should be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 50(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 and for specific financial items in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999;</p>
      <p n="28">(18) Whereas reports should be submitted to the Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on progress achieved in the implementation of agricultural pre-accession aid;</p>
      <p n="29">(19) Whereas, during the transitional period (1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001) all reference to the euro should as a general rule be considered as a reference to the euro as a monetary unit, in accordance with the second sentence of Article 2, of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro(10);</p>
      <p n="30">(20) Whereas the implementation of these measures will help to achieve the Community's aims; whereas the Treaty does not provide for the adoption of this Regulation powers other than those laid down in Article 308,</p>
      <p n="31">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
