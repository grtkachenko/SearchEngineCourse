      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1932/1999</p>
      <p n="3">of 9 September 1999</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1253/1999(2), and in particular Articles 5, 6(2), 7(3), 8(5), 9(2), 13, 16(2), 17(2) and 21 thereof, and the corresponding provisions of the other regulations on the common organisation of the market in agricultural products, and also to other provisions in the regulations on the common organisation of markets which, when applied in practice, call for a security,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 525/77 of 14 March 1977 establishing a system of production aid for tinned pineapple(3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1699/85(4), and in particular Article 8 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1554/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down the general rules for the system of aid for cotton(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1419/98(6), and in particular Article 11(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 of 30 June 1992 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1624/98(8), and in particular Articles 12 and 16 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Whereas numerous provisions of Community agricultural regulations require the lodging of securities and the possible forfeiture thereof;</p>
      <p n="12">(2) Whereas the references to several regulations defining the scope of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85(9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3403/93(10), should be updated for the sake of clarity;</p>
      <p n="13">(3) Whereas with a view to simplifying the administration of the security system certain provisions concerning lodging and forfeiture of small amounts and the calculation of interest should be amended;</p>
      <p n="14">(4) Whereas Articles 31 and 32 of Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 require Member States to communicate certain information to the Commission on the application of the system of securities;</p>
      <p n="15">(5) Whereas, moreover, the clearance of accounts procedure was amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1287/95 of 22 May 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(11), and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1663/95 of 7 July 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 regarding the procedure for the clearance of the accounts of the EAGGF Guarantee Section(12), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 896/97(13);</p>
      <p n="16">(6) Whereas it has emerged that the communication of the information referred to in Articles 31 and 32 of Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 is no longer of systematic interest to the Commission as it was under the former clearance of accounts procedure; whereas, moreover, the new clearance of accounts procedure has simplified the information to be forwarded by the Member States;</p>
      <p n="17">(7) Whereas this information should remain available;</p>
      <p n="18">(8) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the relevant Management Committees,</p>
      <p n="19">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
