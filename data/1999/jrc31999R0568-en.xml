      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 568/1999 of 16 March 1999 amending Regulation (EC) No 577/97 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 laying down standards for spreadable fats and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 568/1999 of 16 March 1999 amending Regulation (EC) No 577/97 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 laying down standards for spreadable fats and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products</p>
      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 of 5 December 1994 laying down standards for spreadable fats (1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 of 2 July 1987 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 222/98 (3), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 577/97 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2521/98 (5), lays down special provisions as regards the use of the designation 'butter` for the group of products composed of butter, sugar and alcohol; whereas it is recognised that some of those products are eligible for the derogation provided for in Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 regarding traditional designations; whereas those products are defined in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 577/97 as products with a minimum fat content of 34 %;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas, according to additional information supplied by the United Kingdom, it seems that some products having a traditional character have a fat content of the order of 20 %; whereas Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 577/97 should therefore be adapted accordingly;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the Management Committees concerned have not delivered opinions within the time limits set by their chairmen,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">In the first indent of point V of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 577/97, '34 %` is replaced by '20 %`.</p>
      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="16">Done at Brussels, 16 March 1999.</p>
      <p n="17">For the Commission</p>
