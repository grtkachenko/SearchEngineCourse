      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 1999/102/EC</p>
      <p n="3">of 15 December 1999</p>
      <p n="4">adapting to technical progress Council Directive 70/220/EEC relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 70/220/EEC of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles(1), as last amended by Directive 98/69/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Directive 70/220/EEC is one of the separate directives under the type-approval procedure laid down by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(3), as last amended by Directive 98/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(4).</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Directive 70/220/EEC lays down the specifications for the testing of emissions of the motor vehicles covered by its scope. In view of the recent experience gained and the rapidly developing state of the art of on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems, it is appropriate to adapt those specifications accordingly with effect from the dates specified in Directive 98/69/EC.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) It is necessary to clarify the dates of application of the OBD requirements of this Directive for new types and all types of vehicles of category M1 equipped with compression-ignition engines and the maximum mass of which exceeds 2500 kg and for vehicles in category N1 classes II and III.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) It is appropriate to clarify the OBD requirements in relation to tamper prevention, disablement of engine misfire monitoring during certain operating conditions, the storage of distance travelled by the vehicle while a malfunction is indicated to the driver through the malfunction indicator, the capability of the OBD system to perform bi-directional logic control, the use of the P1 and P0 fault code sets of ISO 15031-6, the diagnostic connector and to express the OBD threshold limits to two decimal places. It is appropriate to introduce revised provisions for misfire monitoring under conditions likely to cause catalyst damage to reduce the possibility of false fault indications and to introduce the possibility of partial catalyst volume monitoring and the use of the enhanced on-board to off-board communications link provided by controller area network (CAN).</p>
      <p n="14">(5) It is appropriate to allow the type-approval of vehicles with OBD systems that contain a limited number of minor deficiencies that may arise at, or prior to the time of type-approval or are discovered when vehicles are already in service. The type-approval authority may also issue an extension to the type-approval certificate for vehicles that have already been type-approved in cases where deficiencies are subsequently found within the OBD system on vehicles in-service. Such extensions may not be issued if there is a complete lack of monitoring capability. A period should be specified within which deficiencies authorised by the authority must be corrected on future manufactured vehicles.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">Annexes I, VI, X and XI to Directive 70/220/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 1999 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="21">When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.</p>
      <p n="22">2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law that they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
      <p n="24">This Directive shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 4</p>
      <p n="26">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="27">Done at Brussels, 15 December 1999.</p>

      <p n="66">2. This item only concerns the Portuguese version.</p>
      <p n="67">3. A section 2.20 is added as follows: "2.20 "Deficiency" means, in respect of vehicle OBD systems, that up to two separate components or systems that are monitored contain temporary or permanent operating characteristics that impair the otherwise efficient OBD monitoring of those components or systems or do not meet all of the other detailed requirements for OBD.

If misfire at levels likely to cause catalyst damage (as specified by the manufacturer) is not present any more, or if the engine is operated after changes to speed and load conditions where the level of misfire will not cause catalyst damage, the MI may be switched back to the previous state of activation during the first driving cycle on which the misfire level was detected and may be switched to the normal activated mode on subsequent driving cycles. If the MI is switched back to the previous state of activation, the corresponding fault codes and stored freeze-frame conditions may be erased."</p>
      <p n="77">12. A Section 4 is added as follows: "4. Requirements relating to the type-approval of on-board diagnostic systems</p>
      <p n="78">4.1. A manufacturer may request to the authority that an OBD system be accepted for type-approval even though the system contains one or more deficiencies such that the specific requirements of this Annex are not fully met.</p>
      <p n="79">4.2. In considering the request, the authority shall determine whether compliance with the requirements of this Annex is infeasible or unreasonable.</p>
      <p n="80">The authority shall take into consideration data from the manufacturer that details such factors as, but not limited to, technical feasibility, lead time and production cycles including phase-in or phase-out of engines or vehicle designs and programmed upgrades of computers, the extent to which the resultant OBD system will be effective in complying with the requirements of this directive and that the manufacturer has demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward compliance with the requirements of this Directive.</p>
      <p n="81">4.2.1. The authority will not accept any deficiency request that includes the complete lack of a required diagnostic monitor.</p>
      <p n="82">4.2.2. The authority will not accept any deficiency request that does not respect the OBD threshold limits in Section 3.3.2.</p>

      <p n="85">4.5. Deficiency period</p>
      <p n="86">4.5.1. A deficiency may be carried-over for a period of two years after the date of type-approval of the vehicle type unless it can be adequately demonstrated that substantial vehicle hardware modifications and additional lead-time beyond two years would be necessary to correct the deficiency. In such a case, the deficiency may be carried-over for a period not exceeding three years.</p>
      <p n="87">4.5.2. A manufacturer may request that the original type-approval authority grant a deficiency retrospectively when such a deficiency is discovered after the original type-approval. In this case, the deficiency may be carried over for a period of two years after the date of notification to the type-approval authority unless it can be adequately demonstrated that substantial vehicle hardware modifications and additional lead time beyond two years would be necessary to correct the deficiency. In such a case, the deficiency may be carried-over for a period not exceeding three years.</p>
      <p n="88">4.6. The authority shall notify its decision in granting a deficiency request to all authorities in other Member States according to the requirements of Article 4 to Directive 70/156/EEC."</p>
