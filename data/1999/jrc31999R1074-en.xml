      <head n="1">Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OCAF)</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EURATOM) No 1074/1999</p>
      <p n="3">of 25 May 1999</p>
      <p n="4">concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OCAF)</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 203 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors(3),</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Whereas the institutions and the Member States attach great importance to the protection of the Communities' financial interests and to the fight against fraud and any other illegal activities detrimental to the Communities' financial interests; whereas the Commission's responsibility in that connection is closely bound up with its duty to implement the budget under Article 179 of the Euratom Treaty; whereas the importance of action to that end is confirmed by Article 183a of the Euratom Treaty;</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Whereas the protection of the Communities' financial interests extends not only to the management of budget appropriations but also to all measures affecting or liable to affect their assets;</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Whereas all available means must be deployed fully to attain this objective, notably in the context of investigative duties devolving upon the Community, while the current distribution and balance of responsibilities as between the national and Community levels should be maintained;</p>
      <p n="13">(4) Whereas to reinforce the means available for combating fraud, while respecting the principle of each institution's internal organisational autonomy, the Commission has established among its own departments by Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom(4), a European Anti-Fraud Office (hereinafter "the Office") with responsibility for conducting administrative fraud investigations; whereas it has given this Office full independence to exercise its investigative function;</p>
      <p n="14">(5) Whereas the responsibility of the Office as set up by the Commission extends beyond the protection of financial interests to include all activities relating to safeguarding Community interests against irregular conduct liable to result in administrative or criminal proceedings;</p>
      <p n="15">(6) Whereas it is appropriate to provide that the Office ensure cooperation between the Member States and the Commission to protect the Communities' financial interests;</p>
      <p n="16">(7) Whereas, given the need to step up the fight against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities detrimental to the Communities' financial interests, the Office must be able to conduct internal investigations in all the institutions, bodies and offices and agencies established by or on the basis of the EC and Euratom Treaties (hereinafter "the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies");</p>
      <p n="17">(8) Whereas Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom provides that for the purposes of investigations the Office shall exercise the powers conferred by the Community legislator, subject to the limits and conditions laid down thereby;</p>
      <p n="18">(9) Whereas the Office should be entrusted with the exercise of the powers conferred on the Commission by Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities(5); whereas the Office must also be allowed to exercise the other powers conferred on the Commission to conduct on-the-spot checks and inspections in the Member States, notably for the purpose of detecting irregularities as required by Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests(6);</p>
      <p n="19">(10) Whereas these investigations must be conducted in accordance with the Treaty and in particular with the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities, while respecting the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the Communities (hereinafter referred to as "the Staff Regulations"), and with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the principle of fairness, for the right of persons involved to express their views on the facts concerning them and for the principle that the conclusions of an investigation may be based solely on elements which have evidential value; whereas to that end the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies must lay down the terms and conditions under which such internal investigations are conducted; whereas consequently the Staff Regulations should be amended in order to lay down the rights and obligations of officials and other servants as regards internal investigations;</p>
      <p n="20">(11) Whereas these internal investigations can be conducted only if the Office is guaranteed access to all premises of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and to all information and documents held by them;</p>
      <p n="21">(12) Whereas to ensure that the Office is independent in carrying out the tasks conferred on it by this Regulation, its Director must be given the power to open an investigation on his own initiative;</p>
      <p n="22">(13) Whereas it is for the competent national authorities or the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as the case may be, to decide what action should be taken on completed investigations on the basis of the report drawn up by the Office; whereas it should nevertheless be incumbent upon the Director of the Office to forward directly to the judicial authorities of the Member State concerned information acquired by the Office in the course of internal investigations concerning situations liable to result in criminal proceedings;</p>
      <p n="23">(14) Whereas the terms on which the Office's employees will discharge their duties and the terms governing the Director's exercise of his responsibility for the conduct of investigations by the Office's employees should be laid down;</p>
      <p n="24">(15) Whereas, for the sake of successful cooperation between the Office, the Member States and the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, the reciprocal exchange of information must be organised, subject to rules of confidentiality where information is subject to professional secrecy, while ensuring that it enjoys the proper data protection;</p>
      <p n="25">(16) Whereas, to ensure that the findings of investigations conducted by the Office's employees are taken into account and that the requisite follow-up action is taken, the reports should have the status of admissible evidence in administrative and judicial proceedings; whereas, to that end, they should be drawn up in a manner compatible with the rules governing administrative reports in the Member States;</p>
      <p n="26">(17) Whereas the Office should enjoy independence in the discharge of its function; whereas, to reinforce that independence, the Office should be subject to regular monitoring of its investigative function by a Supervisory Committee, made up of outside independent persons highly qualified in the Office's fields of activity; whereas the Committee's duties should also include assisting the Office's Director in discharging his responsibilities;</p>
      <p n="27">(18) Whereas administrative investigations should be conducted under the authority of the Director of the Office, in full independence from the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and from the Supervisory Committee;</p>
      <p n="28">(19) Whereas it should be incumbent on the Director of the Office to ensure the protection of personal data and respect for confidentiality of information gathered in the course of investigations; whereas officials and other servants of the Communities should be assured of legal protection equivalent to that provided for by Articles 90 and 91 of the Staff Regulations;</p>
      <p n="29">(20) Whereas the activities of the Office should be assessed after a three-year period;</p>
      <p n="30">(21) Whereas this Regulation in no way diminishes the powers and responsibilities of the Member States to take measures to combat fraud affecting the Communities' financial interests; whereas entrusting to an independent Office the task of conducting external administrative investigations in this area is accordingly in full compliance with the subsidiarity principle; whereas the operation of the Office is likely to step up the fight against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the Communities' financial interests and is therefore compatible with the proportionality principle,</p>
      <p n="31">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="32">Article 1</p>
      <p n="33">Objectives and tasks</p>

The Committee may submit reports to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the court of Auditors on the results of the Office's investigations and the action taken thereon.</p>
      <p n="108">Article 12</p>

      <p n="111">2.
