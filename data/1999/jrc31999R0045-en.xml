      <p n="3">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2821/98 (2), and in particular Article 9g(3)(a) thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas coccidiostats and other medicinal substances included in Annex I to Directive 70/524/EEC prior to 1 January 1998 are provisionally authorised as from 1 April 1998 and transferred to Chapter I of Annex B with a view to their re-evaluation as additives linked to a person responsible for putting them into circulation;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas the Commission must withdraw provisional authorisations for coccidiostats and other medicinal substances for which there have been no new applications for authorisation before 1 October 1998 accompanied by a monograph and identification note addressed by the person responsible for the dossier on the basis of which the former authorisation was granted or by his successor or successors, via the Member State acting as rapporteur, to the Commission;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas no such applications have been addressed to the Commission for the coccidiostats and other medicinal substances arprinocide, dinitolmide and ipronidazole; whereas the requirements of Directive 70/524/EEC have not therefore been met and the authorisations granted to those additives should be withdrawn and their entries deleted from Chapter I of Annex B to that Directive;</p>

      <p n="14">- dinitolmide,</p>
      <p n="15">- ipronidazole.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 2</p>
      <p n="17">This Regulation shall enter into force on 30 September 1999.</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="19">Done at Brussels, 11 January 1999.</p>
