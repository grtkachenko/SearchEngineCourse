      <p n="11">Whereas Article 15(4)(c) of the said Regulation should be clarified;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the present provisions on defrayal by the Community of transport, sorting and packaging costs in connection with certain products withdrawn from the market and then distributed free should apply to all free distribution of withdrawn products,</p>

      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
