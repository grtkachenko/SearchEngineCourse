      <p n="9">Whereas dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings are frequently contaminated and/or infested with organisms and their metabolites which are harmful to public health;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas such contamination and/or infestation can no longer be treated with fumigants such as ethylene oxide because of the toxic potential of their residues;</p>

      <p n="12">Whereas such treatment has been accepted by the Scientific Committee for Food;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas such treatment is therefore in the interest of public health protection,</p>

      <p n="17">2. Treatment of the products in question with ionising radiation may be carried out only in accordance with the provisions of the framework Directive. In particular, test methods shall be used in accordance with Article 7(3) of the framework Directive.</p>
      <p n="18">3. The foodstuffs that may be treated with ionising radiation and the maximum overall average dose that may be imparted are listed in the Annex.</p>

      <p n="20">Member States may not prohibit, resrict or hinder the marketing of foodstuffs irradiated in accordance with the general provisions of the framework Directive and the provisions of this Directive on the grounds that they have been so treated.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 3</p>
      <p n="22">Any amendments to this Directive, shall be made in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 100a of the Treaty.</p>
