      <p n="8">(1) Whereas enquiries and further verifications, carried out both in the Community and elsewhere with the assistance of third countries' authorities, in accordance with the procedures established in Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 have led the Commission to conclude that 5408295 pieces of textile products pertaining to category 4 (T-shirts) have been imported into the European Community in circumvention of the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 in the years 1995 and 1996 in that evidence shows that they physically emanated from the territory of the People's Republic of China before having been imported into the European Community without Chinese origin being declared or under false declarations of origin;</p>
      <p n="9">(2) Whereas consultations with the People's Republic of China were requested and held in order to clarify the situation and determine, on the basis in particular of the documentary evidence submitted by the European Commission, the true origin of the products concerned and reach an agreement on an equivalent adjustment of the quantitative limit applicable to exports of the concerned category to the European Community from the People's Republic of China;</p>
      <p n="10">(3) Whereas on 6 July 1999 agreement was reached on the adjustment which should be made which is deemed to constitute a satisfactory solution within the meaning of Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 by way of effecting deductions in two yearly instalments of goods of the amount of 5408295 pieces of category 4;</p>
      <p n="11">(4) Whereas the first adjustment should be made on the quantitative limit set out for the quota year 1999 by the current bilateral agreement on trade in textile and clothing goods which will expire on 31 December 1999;</p>
      <p n="12">(5) Whereas a further deduction should be made on the quantitative limit applicable for the quota year 2000;</p>
      <p n="13">(6) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textile Committee established by Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93,</p>
