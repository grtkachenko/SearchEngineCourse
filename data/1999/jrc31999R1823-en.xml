      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1823/1999 of 20 August 1999 determining the sensitive production areas and/or the groups of high-quality varieties exempt from application of the quota buyback programme in raw tobacco</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1823/1999</p>
      <p n="3">of 20 August 1999</p>
      <p n="4">determining the sensitive production areas and/or the groups of high-quality varieties exempt from application of the quota buyback programme in raw tobacco</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 660/1999(2), and in particular Article 14a thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">(1) Whereas, pursuant to Article 34(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 as regards the premium scheme, production quotas and the specific aid to be granted to producer groups in the raw tobacco sector(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1373/1999(4), the Commission must determine, on the basis of proposals from the Member States, which sensitive production areas and/or groups of high-quality varieties, up to a maximum of 25 % of each Member State's guarantee threshold, are to be exempt from application of the quota buyback programme;</p>
      <p n="9">(2) Whereas, at the request of certain Member States, these groups of high-quality varieties should be determined;</p>
      <p n="10">(3) Whereas, because Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 stipulates that the Member State must make publics its intention to sell from 1 September so that other producers may buy the quota before it is actually bought back, this Regulation must apply from 31 August 1999,</p>
      <p n="11">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="12">Article 1</p>
      <p n="13">The quantities of groups of high-quality varieties exempt from quota buyback for the 1999 harvest are as follows:</p>
      <p n="14">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="15">Article 2</p>
      <p n="16">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="17">It shall apply from 31 August 1999.</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="19">Done at Brussels, 20 August 1999.</p>
      <p n="20">For the Commission</p>
