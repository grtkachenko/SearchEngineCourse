      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Decision 1999/280/EC regarding a Community procedure for information and consultation on crude oil supply costs and the consumer prices of petroleum products(1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Whereas it is desirable that Member States should present the information referred to in Decision 1999/280/EC in such a way as to give the most representative picture possible of each Member State's oil market;</p>
      <p n="12">(2) Whereas such information should be published in an appropriate form;</p>
      <p n="13">(3) Whereas the Member States and the Commission should consult each other over the information collected;</p>

      <p n="15">(5) Whereas Commission Decision 77/190/EEC(2), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, laid down model questionnaires through which the Member States are required to communicate to the Commission the information on prices of crude oil and petroleum products in the Community; whereas, since those model questionnaires are to be replaced by a new presentation conforming to the definitions contained in this Decision, it follows that Decision 77/190/EEC should be repealed,</p>

      <p n="22">The Member States shall consult each other within a working party of representatives of the Member States in order to exchange views at regular intervals on the information collected and published pursuant to Decision 1999/280/EC.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 4</p>
