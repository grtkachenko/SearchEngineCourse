      <p n="2">COMMISSION DECISION</p>
      <p n="3">of 14 July 1999</p>
      <p n="4">renewing the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture</p>
      <p n="5">(notified under document number C(1999) 2042)</p>
      <p n="6">(1999/478/EC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Whereas it is important for the Commission to obtain the reactions of the interests concerned on the questions raised by the establishment of a common fisheries policy (CFP);</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Whereas an advisory committee (ACF) was created in the fisheries sector by Commission Decision 71/128/EEC(1) the text of which as last replaced by Decision 89/4/EEC(2), as amended by Decision 97/246/EC(3);</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Whereas it appears opportune to widen, within the framework of the ACF, the dialogue on the development and management of the CFP to all parties concerned, in particular to the aquaculture sector and non-professionnal organisations; whereas for this purpose it is necessary to re-examine the structure of the Committee;</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Whereas, in order to encourage the formulation of analyses and of joint positions on the CFP, it is useful to invite the members of ACF to deal first of all with questions of concern to them;</p>
      <p n="13">(5) Whereas in the interests of efficiency it is necessary to limit the number of members of the Committee;</p>
      <p n="14">(6) Whereas it is useful to improve the dialogue by means of a better link between the plenary committee, assigned to direct the work of the Committee and to express opinions, and the working groups charged with preparing these opinions;</p>
      <p n="15">(7) Whereas the mandate of the members of the Committee expires on 31 July 1999 at the end of a transitional period set for the reform of the aforementioned Committee and that it is therefore appropriate to amend the text of the Decision in the sense indicated above;</p>
      <p n="16">(8) Whereas in the interests of clarity the text of Decision 71/128/EEC should be replaced,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
