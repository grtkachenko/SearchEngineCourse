      <head n="1">1999/311/EC: Council Decision of 29 April 1999 adopting the third phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (Tempus III) (2000-2006)</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL DECISION</p>
      <p n="3">of 29 April 1999</p>
      <p n="4">adopting the third phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (Tempus III) (2000-2006)</p>
      <p n="5">(1999/311/EC)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),</p>
      <p n="11">Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(4),</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Whereas the European Council meeting in Strasbourg on 8 and 9 December 1989 called on the Council to adopt, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, measures aimed at enabling the central and eastern European countries to take part in programmes in the areas of education and/or training similar to the existing Community programmes;</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Whereas on 18 December 1989 the Council adopted Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 on economic aid to the Republic of Hungary and the Polish People's Republic(5) (PHARE programme), which provides for aid to support the process of economic and social reform in central and eastern European countries in areas including training; whereas on 25 June 1996 the Council adopted Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 1279/96 concerning the provision of assistance to economic reform and recovery in the new independent States and Mongolia(6) (TACIS programme);</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Whereas on 29 April 1993 by Decision 93/246/EEC the Council adopted the second phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (Tempus II) for a period of four years from 1 July 1994(7); whereas that Decision was amended on 21 November 1996 by Decision 96/663/EC(8) to extend to six years the duration of this programme (1994-2000);</p>
      <p n="15">(4) Whereas the countries of central and eastern Europe, the new independent States of the former Soviet Union and Mongolia, which are beneficiaries of the PHARE and TACIS programmes, consider higher education and training to be key areas for the process of economic and social reform;</p>
      <p n="16">(5) Whereas cooperation on higher education strengthens and deepens the whole fabric of relations existing between the peoples of Europe, brings out common cultural values, allows fruitful exchanges of views to take place and facilitates multinational activities in the scientific, cultural, artistic, economic and social spheres;</p>
      <p n="17">(6) Whereas the recent establishment of Tempus in the non-associated countries of central and eastern Europe, in the new independent States of the former Soviet Union and in Mongolia, whose needs are greater and whose areas are more extensive, fully warrants the continuation of the measures undertaken;</p>
      <p n="18">(7) Whereas Tempus can make an effective contribution to the structural development of higher education including the improvement of human resources and occupational skills adapted to economic reform and whereas there is no other instrument for achieving this objective;</p>
      <p n="19">(8) Whereas Tempus can also make an effective contribution, via universities and university staff, to the development of public administration and education structures in the eligible countries;</p>
      <p n="20">(9) Whereas Tempus can contribute to the restoration of cooperation, interrupted by recent events, between neighbouring regions of the Community and whereas this cooperation is a factor of peace and stability in Europe;</p>
      <p n="21">(10) Whereas the associated countries in the pre-accession phase which have taken part in Tempus I and Tempus II could now, thanks to the experience they have acquired, make a useful contribution alongside the Member States in assisting the partner countries who came into the programme at a much later stage to restructure their higher education systems;</p>
      <p n="22">(11) Whereas Article 11 of Decision 93/246/EEC stipulates that the Commission must carry out an evaluation of the implementation of the Tempus programme and submit no later than 30 April 1998 a proposal for the extension or the adjustment of the programme for the period commencing on 1 July 2000;</p>
      <p n="23">(12) Whereas the competent authorities in the countries of central and eastern Europe, the new independent States of the former Soviet Union and Mongolia, the users of the programme, the structures responsible for organising it in the eligible countries and in the European Community, and the experts and qualified representatives reflecting the views of the university world in Europe, share the findings of the evaluation report attesting to the capacity of Tempus to make an effective contribution in the eligible countries to the diversification of educational opportunities and to cooperation between universities, thereby paving the way for the development of scientific, cultural and economic and social cooperation;</p>
      <p n="24">(13) Whereas the possibility should be provided of creating effective coordination between the Tempus III programme and other Community programmes or activities with an educational and/or training-related dimension, thus stimulating synergies and increasing the added value of each of the Community activities;</p>
      <p n="25">(14) Whereas the Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Decision, powers other than those of Article 235; whereas the conditions for invoking that Article have been satisfied,</p>
      <p n="26">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="27">Article 1</p>
      <p n="28">Duration of Tempus III</p>
      <p n="29">The third phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (hereinafter referred to as "Tempus III") is hereby adopted for a period of six years as from 1 July 2000.</p>
      <p n="30">Article 2</p>
      <p n="31">Eligible countries</p>
      <p n="32">Tempus III shall concern the non-associated countries of central and eastern Europe eligible for economic aid by virtue of Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 (PHARE programme)(9), and the new independent States of the former Soviet Union and Mongolia mentioned in Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 1279/96 (TACIS programme), subject to these assistance programmes being prolonged for the period referred to. These countries are hereinafter referred to as "eligible countries".</p>
      <p n="33">On the basis of an evaluation of the specific situation of each country the Commission, in accordance with the procedures set out in the said Regulations, shall agree with the eligible countries concerned whether they should participate in Tempus III, and the nature and conditions of their participation in the national planning of Community assistance for social and economic reform.</p>
      <p n="34">Article 3</p>
      <p n="35">Involvement of associated countries</p>
      <p n="36">Actions under Tempus III are also open to the associated countries of central and eastern Europe so that what has been achieved through Tempus can be shared with the neighbouring countries and in order to develop regional and cross-border cooperation. Taking into account the respective financial rules and regulations, cooperation between Tempus and Erasmus projects should be encouraged.</p>
      <p n="37">Article 4</p>
      <p n="38">Definitions</p>
      <p n="39">For the purposes of Tempus III:</p>
      <p n="40">(a) the term "university" shall be used to cover all types of post-secondary educational and vocational training establishments which offer, within the framework of advanced education and training, qualifications or diplomas of that level, whatever such establishments may be called;</p>
      <p n="41">(b) the terms "industry" and "company" shall be used to cover all types of economic activity, irrespective of legal status, autonomous business organisations, chambers of commerce and industry and/or their equivalents, professional associations, and the training bodies of the institutions and organisations mentioned above;</p>
      <p n="42">(c) the term "institution" shall be used to cover local and public authorities, and the social partners' and their training bodies.</p>
      <p n="43">Each Member State or eligible country may determine what types of establishment referred to in point (a) can participate in Tempus III.</p>
      <p n="44">Article 5</p>
      <p n="45">Aims</p>
      <p n="46">The aim of Tempus III is to promote, in line with the guidelines and general objectives of the PHARE and TACIS programmes for economic and social reform, the development of the higher education systems in the eligible countries through the most balanced cooperation possible with the partners from all the Member States of the Community.</p>
      <p n="47">More specifically, Tempus III is intended to facilitate the adaptation of higher education to the new socio-economic and cultural needs of the eligible countries by addressing:</p>

      <p n="49">(b) reform of higher education structures and establishments and their management;</p>
      <p n="50">(c) the development of training leading to qualifications, with a view to making good the shortage of high-level skills needed in the context of economic reform, particularly by improving and increasing links with industry;</p>
      <p n="51">(d) the contribution of higher education and training to citizenship and the strengthening of democracy.</p>
      <p n="52">The Commission will, when pursuing the objectives of Tempus III, endeavour to adhere to the Community's general policy on equal opportunities for men and women. The Commission will also endeavour to ensure that no group of citizens is excluded or disadvantaged.</p>
      <p n="53">Article 6</p>
      <p n="54">Dialogue with the eligible countries</p>
      <p n="55">In agreement with the competent authorities in each country, the Commission will define the detailed priorities and objectives for the role of Tempus III in the national strategy for economic and social reform, on the basis of the programme's objectives and the provisions set out in the Annex, and in conformity in particular with:</p>
