      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2846/98(2), and in particular Article 6(8) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 provides that from 1 January 2000 catches of an amount greater than 50 kg of live-weight equivalent of any species retained on board must be recorded in the logbook. However, for fisheries operations in the Mediterranean Sea, only the species indicated on a list adopted under that Article must be recorded in the logbook.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) According to Article 40 of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93, the provisions contained in that Regulation concerning the logbook and the landing declaration will apply, with effect from 1 january 2000, to fisheries operations in the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) It is necessary, therefore, to amend, with effect from 1 January 2000, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 of 22 September 1983 laying down detailed rules for recording information on Member States' catches of fish(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1488/98(4), in order to ensure that the requirements are met.</p>

      <p n="19">2. The logbook shown in Annex I, II or IIa shall also be kept in the manner prescribed in paragraph 1 when such vessels are operating in the waters of a non-member country, unless the non-member country in question specifically requires a different kind of logbook.</p>
      <p n="20">3. For fisheries operations in the Mediterranean, any amount greater than 50 kg of live-weight equivalent of any species retained on board shall be recorded in the logbook.</p>
      <p n="21">4. The codes given in Annex VI and the Three-Alpha codes established by the FAO shall be used for indicating, under the appropriate headings of the logbook, the fishing gear used and the species caught."</p>
      <p n="22">2.
