      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1467/1999</p>
      <p n="3">of 5 July 1999</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 as regards the aid scheme to compensate for loss of income from marketing in the banana sector</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999(2), and in particular Articles 12 and 14 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro(3), and in particular Article 3(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1062/1999(5), lays down detailed rules for applying the system of compensatory aid for loss of income from the marketing of bananas;</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Whereas the average production income is established on the basis of the average of prices at the stage of delivery at first port of unloading in the rest of the Community less the average costs of transport and delivery fob; whereas experience has shown that in practice the average costs deducted from the average value of bananas at the stage of delivery at the first port of unloading (goods not unloaded) have remained relatively stable to date; whereas, this being the case, administration of the scheme could be greatly simplified by providing for a flat-rate amount to be deducted, while complying with the criteria laid down in the rules; whereas the average production income for bananas produced and marketed in their producer region as defined in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 must be established separately on the basis of the selling prices on local markets, less a flat-rate amount for the forwarding costs to the markets concerned;</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Whereas such flat-rate amounts must be reviewed to ensure that they keep pace with real costs, in particular transport costs;</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Whereas experience has shown that the dates by which operators are to submit their applications for advances to the competent authorities of the Member States should be extended to give operators enough time to prepare their applications;</p>
      <p n="13">(5) Whereas, for the purposes of calculating the compensatory aid, it is justified to break down all the information on the marketing of bananas forwarded to the Commission by bananas dispatched to the Community outside their producer region and bananas placed on the market in a producer region as defined in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93;</p>
      <p n="14">(6) Whereas the definition of the operative event for the aid for the purposes of payment of advances and payment of the balance of the aid should be adapted;</p>
      <p n="15">(7) Whereas, with a view to appreciably simplifying the administration of these arrangements, this Regulation should apply during 1999; whereas the inclusion of certain costs, in particular for forwarding and transport, by means of flat-rate amounts is based directly on information obtained by Member States during the marketing of the products;</p>
      <p n="16">(8) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>

In the case of bananas marketed in the Community outside their producer region as defined in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, the average production income shall be determined for each year on the basis of the average of the prices of bananas from the producer regions at the stage of delivery at first port of unloading (goods not unloaded), less a flat-rate amount of EUR 18,7/100 kg net weight corresponding to average costs of transport and delivery fob.</p>
      <p n="23">In the case of bananas produced and marketed in a producer region as defined in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, the average production income shall be determined on the basis of the average selling prices on local markets, less a flat-rate amount of EUR 0,29/100 kg net weight corresponding to the forwarding costs to the markets concerned.</p>

      <p n="38">8. Article 12(1) is replaced by the following: "1.

      <p n="39">The rate of interest to be applied by the producer Member States with the exception of Greece shall be that fixed by the European Central Bank and published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
