      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 15 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">WHEREAS the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions 50/245 of 10 September 1996 called upon all States to sign and thereafter to become parties to the CTBT at the earliest opportunity;</p>
      <p n="9">RECALLING the provision in Article XIV.2 of the Treaty for a Conference to be convened, at the request of a majority of the States that have ratified, to examine the extent to which the requirement set out in paragraph 1 of this Article has been met and to consider and decide by consensus what measures consistent with international law may be undertaken to accelerate the ratification process in order to facilitate the early entry into force of this Treaty,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING COMMON POSITION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">The objective of this Common Position shall be to contribute to the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) as an important step to promoting nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament which contribute to international confidence, stability and peace.</p>
      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">The European Union shall in particular contribute to a successful outcome of the first conference pursuant to Article XIV of the CTBT, which is expected to take place in Vienna in October 1999, aiming at accelerating the CTBT-ratification process in order to facilitate the early entry into force of the CTBT.</p>
      <p n="15">To this end the European Union shall support:</p>
      <p n="16">(a) the convening of the Conference at political level;</p>
      <p n="17">(b) the convening of subsequent conferences as stipulated in Article XIV of the CTBT until the entry into force of the CTBT;</p>
      <p n="18">(c) the broadest participation of States who have ratified or signed the CTBT as well as States that have not yet signed;</p>
      <p n="19">(d) the presence of NGO's at the Conference;</p>
      <p n="20">(e) measures consistent with international law which may be undertaken to accelerate the ratification process in order to facilitate the early entry into force of the CTBT;</p>
      <p n="21">(f) a final declaration of the Conference which would give the necessary political support for efforts to accelerate the ratification process and the early entry into force of the CTBT;</p>
      <p n="22">(g) the identification of possible ways to assist countries in their national ratification and implementation process, including the exchange of information on the establishment of national authorities and implementation legislation.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
      <p n="24">The European Union shall continue to support the efforts of the Preparatory Commission of the CTBT Organisation to establish the CTBT's verification regime in a timely and effective manner and in accordance with the CTBT.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 4</p>
      <p n="26">The European Union shall encourage all States, which have not yet done so, to sign and ratify the CTBT without delay, in particular those States on the list of 44, whose ratification is necessary for the entry into force of the CTBT.</p>
      <p n="27">Article 5</p>
      <p n="28">The Council will review the implementation of this Common Position with a view to considering the possibility of further activities to be pursued in order to facilitate the early entry into force of the CTBT.</p>
      <p n="29">Article 6</p>
      <p n="30">This Common Position shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.</p>
      <p n="31">Article 7</p>
      <p n="32">This Common Position shall be published in the Official Journal.</p>
      <p n="33">Done at Brussels, 29 July 1999.</p>

      <p n="35">The President</p>
