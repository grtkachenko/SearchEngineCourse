      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 1999/15/EC</p>
      <p n="3">of 16 March 1999</p>
      <p n="4">adapting to technical progress Council Directive 76/759/EEC relating to direction indicator lamps for motor vehicles and their trailers</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(1), as last amended by Directive 98/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 76/759/EEC of 27 June 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to direction indicator lamps for motor vehicles and their trailers(3), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Article 10 thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Whereas Directive 76/759/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval procedure which has been established by Directive 70/156/EEC; whereas, consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 76/759/EEC;</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Whereas, in particular, Article 3(4) and Article 4(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC require each separate Directive to have attached to it an information document and also a type-approval certificate based on Annex VI to Directive 70/156/EEC in order that type-approval may be computerised; whereas the type-approval certificate provided for in Directive 76/759/EEC should be amended accordingly;</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Whereas the procedures should be simplified in order to maintain the equivalence envisaged by Article 9(2) of Directive 70/156/EEC between certain separate Directives and the corresponding regulations of the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE), when those regulations are amended; whereas, as a first step, the technical requirements of Directive 76/759/EEC should be replaced by those of UN-ECE Regulation No 6 by way of cross-reference;</p>
      <p n="13">(4) Whereas it is necessary to ensure that the requirements in Council Directive 76/756/EEC(4), as last amended by Commission Directive 97/28/EC(5), and in Council Directive 76/761/EEC(6), as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/17/EC(7), are complied with;</p>
      <p n="14">(5) Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">Directive 76/759/EEC is amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="18">1. In Article 1, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="19">"1. Each Member State shall grant EC component type-approval for any type of direction indicator lamp which satisfies the construction and testing requirements laid down in the relevant Annexes."</p>
      <p n="20">2. In Article 2, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="21">"Member States shall, for each type of direction indicator lamp which they approve pursuant to Article 1, issue to the manufacturer an EC component type-approval mark conforming to the model shown in Annex I, Appendix 3."</p>
      <p n="22">3. Article 4 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="23">"Article 4</p>
      <p n="24">The competent authorities of the Member States shall inform each other, by means of the procedures specified in Article 4(6) of Directive 70/156/EEC, of each approval which they have granted, refused or withdrawn pursuant to this Directive."</p>
      <p n="25">4. Article 9 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="26">"Article 9</p>

      <p n="39">4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, for the purposes of replacement parts Member States shall continue to grant EC type-approval of direction indicator lamps, and to permit their sale and entry into service, in accordance with previous versions of Directive 76/759/EEC provided that such direction indicator lamps:</p>
      <p n="40">- are intended to be fitted to vehicles already in use, and</p>
      <p n="41">- comply with the requirements of that Directive which were applicable when the vehicles where first registered.</p>
      <p n="42">Article 3</p>
