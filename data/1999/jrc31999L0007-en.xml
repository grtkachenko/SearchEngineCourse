      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to Council Directive 70/311/EEC of 8 June 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the steering equipment for motor vehicles and their trailers (1), as last amended by Directive 92/62/EEC (2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,</p>
      <p n="6">Whereas Directive 70/311/EEC is one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval procedure which has been established by Council Directive 70/156/EEC (3), as last amended by Commission Directive 98/14/EC (4), relating to type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers; whereas consequently the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 70/311/EEC;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas, with a view to the practical application of Directive 70/311/EEC, it is necessary to ensure that uniform provisions are laid down which are also aligned with the latest version of UN-ECE Regulation No 79 in all Member States;</p>
