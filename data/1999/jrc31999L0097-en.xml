      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 1999/97/EC</p>
      <p n="3">of 13 December 1999</p>
      <p n="4">amending Council Directive 95/21/EC concerning the enforcement, in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States, of international standards for ship safety, pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions (port State control)</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 95/21/EC of 19 June 1995 concerning the enforcement, in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States, of international standards for ship safety, pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions (port State control)(1), as last amended by Directive 98/42/EC3(2), and in particular Article 19 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Whereas it is necessary to take account of amendments which have entered into force to the conventions, protocols, codes and resolutions of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), and developments within the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (Paris MOU);</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Whereas publication of information concerning ships detained in Community ports according to Directive 95/21/EC may be an incentive to their owners to take corrective action without being compelled to do so, and may raise the safety awareness in the shipping industry;</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Whereas to this end, the list of information to be published should be expanded, notably in order to include more detailed information on the ship involved, the detention and the action taken, as well as information on ships which have been refused access to Community ports; whereas it should be more clearly established where deficiencies which led to the detention of the vessel lie within the survey responsibilities of classification societies; whereas the efficiency of such measure should be enhanced through a more frequent publication of information, on a monthly basis;</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Whereas a better transparency on the data related to inspections of vessels is a necessary and important element for the promotion of quality in shipping both within the Community and worldwide; whereas the methods for making such information more widely and timely available should be defined in cooperation between the Member States and the Commission;</p>
      <p n="13">(5) Whereas Member States should take all necessary measures to remove any legal obstacle to the publication of the list of ships inspected, detained or being refused access to any port of the Community, in particular through the modification, where appropriate, of their national legislation concerning the protection of data;</p>
      <p n="14">(6) Whereas the overall targeting factor described in Annex I, Part II, to Directive 95/21lEC needs to be improved in the light of experience gained in its implementation; whereas the target factor value may be frequently adjusted within the framework of the Paris MOU and subsequently incorporated into the Sirenac system; whereas it is sufficient to consult the Sirenac database to know the value of the target factor of a vessel; whereas it appears consequently unnecessary to incorporate this value into Directive 95/21/EC;</p>
      <p n="15">(7) Whereas the list of certificates and documents referred to in Annex II to Directive 95/21/EC should be modified in order to take into account amendments which have entered into force to international legislation;</p>
      <p n="16">(8) Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up pursuant to Article 12 of Council Directive 93/75/EEC(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 98/74/EC(4),</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>

      <p n="60">1. Ships visiting a port of a Member State for the first time or after an absence of 12 months or more. In applying these criteria Member States shall also take into account those inspections which have been carried out by members of the MOU. In the absence of appropriate data for this purpose, Member States shall rely upon the available Sirenac data and inspect those ships which have not been registered in the Sirenac following the entry into force of that database on 1 January 1993.</p>
      <p n="61">2. Ships not inspected by any Member State within the previous six months.</p>
      <p n="62">3. Ships whose statutory certificates on the ship's construction and equipment, issued in accordance with the conventions, and the classification certificates, have been issued by an organisation which is not recognised under the terms of Council Directive 94/57/EC of 22 November 1994 on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations (OJ L 319, 12.12.1994, p. 20).</p>
      <p n="63">4. Ships flying the flag of a State appearing in the three-year rolling average table of above-average detentions and delays published in the annual report of the MOU.</p>
      <p n="64">5. Ships which have been permitted to leave the port of a Member State on certain conditions, such as:</p>
      <p n="65">(a) deficiencies to be rectified before departure;</p>
      <p n="66">(b) deficiencies to be rectified at the next port;</p>
      <p n="67">(c) deficiencies to be rectified within 14 days;</p>
      <p n="68">(d) deficiencies for which other conditions have been specified.</p>
      <p n="69">If ship-related action has been taken and all deficiencies have been rectified, this is taken into account.</p>

      <p n="71">7. Ships which have been detained in a previous port.</p>

      <p n="76">12. Other ships above 13 years old.</p>
      <p n="77">In determining the order of priority for the inspection of the ships listed above, the competent authority shall take into account the order indicated by the overall target factor displayed on the Sirenac information system, according to Annex I, Section 1 of the Paris MOU. A higher target factor is indicative of a higher priority. The target factor is the sum of the applicable target factor values as defined withim the framework of the MOU. Items 5, 6 and 7 shall only apply to inspections carried out in the last 12 months. The overall target factor shall not be less than the sum of the values established for the items 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.</p>
      <p n="78">If within three months from the introduction in the framework of the MOU of new target factor values, the Commission is of the view that these values are inappropriate, it may decide, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 19 of Directive 95/21/EC that these values shall not apply for the purposes of this Directive."</p>
