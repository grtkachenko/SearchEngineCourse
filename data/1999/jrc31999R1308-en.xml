      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1308/1999</p>
      <p n="3">of 15 June 1999</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) since the adoption of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90(4), the regulatory environment for veterinary medicinal products has altered radically, in particular as a result of the entry into force of Council Regulation (EC) No 2309/93 of 22 July laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products(5) and of the amendments made by Directive 93/40/EEC(6) to Council Directive 81/851/EEC of 28 September 1981 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to veterinary medicinal products(7), and to Council Directive 81/852/EEC of 28 September 1981 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to analytical, pharmaco-toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of veterinary medicinal products(8);</p>
      <p n="12">(2) the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products is henceforth responsible to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and it falls to that Agency, through that Committee, to issue an opinion on the maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products which are acceptable in foodstuffs of animal origin in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;</p>
      <p n="13">(3) Council Regulation (EC) No 297/95 of 10 February 1995 on fees payable to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products(9) establishes the fees payable to the Agency for examining applications for the establishment, amendment and extension of maximum residue limits;</p>
      <p n="14">(4) it is necessary, consequently, to amend Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 by conferring on the Agency the task of dealing with applications for the establishment, amendment and extension of maximum residue limits and by aligning the decision-making process with respect to the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for veterinary use with that introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93;</p>
      <p n="15">(5) the Agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures which emerged from the multilateral negotiations of the Uruguay Round, approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 94/800/EC of 22 December 1994 concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community, as regards matters within its competence, of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations (1986 to 1994)(10) creates transparency obligations as regards health measures; Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 must therefore be adapted in order to enable the Community to fulfil its obligations under that Agreement;</p>
      <p n="16">(6) it is also necessary to rectify certain material errors in Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>

The deadline for the opinion shall then be deferred until the additional information has been received.</p>
      <p n="29">4. The Agency shall forward the opinion to the applicant. Within 15 days of receipt of the opinion, the applicant may provide written notice to the Agency that he wishes to appeal. In that case he shall forward the detailed grounds for his appeal to the Agency within 60 days of receipt of the opinion. Within 60 days of the receipt of the grounds for appeal, the Committee shall consider whether its opinion should be revised and the reasons for the conclusion reached on the appeal shall be annexed to the report referred to in paragraph 5.</p>
