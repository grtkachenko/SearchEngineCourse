      <p n="9">Whereas Article 4(d) of Regulation (EC) No 2597/97(3) lays down that drinking milk must have a fat-free dry matter content of 8,50 % (m/m) or more for milk containing 3,5 % (m/m) of fat or an equivalent content in the case of milk having a different fat content; whereas it has been found that raw milk in some Member States does not attain the rate specified for part or all of the year; that situation could jeopardise drinking milk supplies in certain regions of the Community; in view of the restrictions laid down in Article 3(2) of the said Regulation regarding modification of the fat-free dry matter of milk and the other additional requirements laid down in Article 4 of the said Regulation, Article 4(d) should be deleted with effect from 1 January 1999,</p>
