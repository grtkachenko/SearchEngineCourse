      <p n="2">DECISION No 1720/1999/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL</p>
      <p n="3">of 12 July 1999</p>
      <p n="4">adopting a series of actions and measures in order to ensure interoperability of and access to trans-European networks for the electronic interchange of data between administrations (IDA)</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 156 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Whereas the Council, in its resolution of 20 June 1994(5), emphasised the need for coordination with regard to information exchange between administrations;</p>
      <p n="12">(2) Whereas the Council, in its resolution of 21 November 1996(6), established new policy priorities regarding the information society;</p>
      <p n="13">(3) Whereas the Commission, in its communication of 19 July 1994, proposed an action plan for the information society;</p>
      <p n="14">(4) Whereas the Commission has proposed an action plan for the single market;</p>
      <p n="15">(5) Whereas the European Parliament, in its resolution of 12 June 1997(7), invited the European Union and the Member States to take action with regard to the development and application of new information and communication technologies (ICT) in the next decade;</p>
      <p n="16">(6) Whereas the European Parliament and the Council, in Decision No 2717/95/EC(8), adopted a series of guidelines for the development of Euro-ISDN as a trans-European network;</p>
      <p n="17">(7) Whereas the European Parliament and the Council, in Decision No 1336/97/EC(9), adopted a series of guidelines for trans-European telecommunication networks;</p>
      <p n="18">(8) Whereas the Council, in its recommendation of 7 April 1995 on common information technology security evaluation criteria (ITSEC)(10), recommended the use of security evaluation criteria within evaluation and certification schemes;</p>
      <p n="19">(9) Whereas, in order to establish economic and monetary union, to implement Community policies and activities and to support communication between the Community institutions and bodies, there is a need to establish integrated data communications systems between administrations, hereinafter referred to as "telematic networks";</p>
      <p n="20">(10) Whereas such networks must link the information systems, both existing and future, of the Member State administrations and the Community across Europe and are, therefore, trans-European telecommunication networks for administrations;</p>
      <p n="21">(11) Whereas the effective linkage of such information systems requires a maximum degree of interoperability between the various systems and their components;</p>
      <p n="22">(12) Whereas it is essential to maximise the use of standards, publicly available specifications and public domain applications to ensure seamless interoperability in order to achieve economies of scale and to increase the benefits of such networks;</p>
      <p n="23">(13) Whereas an enhanced interface with public administrations will encourage citizens of the European Union to reap the benefits of the information society;</p>
      <p n="24">(14) Whereas the elimination of obstacles to communication between public administrations and the private sector is an important factor for the prosperity and competitiveness of Community industry;</p>
      <p n="25">(15) Whereas the Community is a user or a beneficiary of those telematic networks which support Community policies and activities, interinstitutional communication and economic and monetary union;</p>
      <p n="26">(16) Whereas the task of establishing such networks is incumbent on both the Community and the Member States;</p>
      <p n="27">(17) Whereas, in order to make efficient use of the Community's financial resources, it is necessary to avoid needless proliferation of equipment, repetition of investigations and diversity of approach;</p>
      <p n="28">(18) Whereas common tools and techniques for sectoral network applications can, inter alia, be related to document management and dissemination, data gathering, multilingual user interfaces and security of electronic communication;</p>
      <p n="29">(19) Whereas cost-efficiency, responsiveness, flexibility and adaptability to technological change in the establishment and operation of such networks can best be achieved by embracing a market-oriented approach and thus selecting suppliers on a competitive basis in a multi-vendor environment;</p>
      <p n="30">(20) Whereas any measures to ensure interoperability between and access to such networks must maintain a judicious balance between satisfying common requirements and preserving national specificities;</p>
      <p n="31">(21) Whereas there is thus a need to carry out specific horizontal actions and measures in order to ensure interoperability between such networks;</p>
      <p n="32">(22) Whereas, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality established by Article 5 of the Treaty the objective of carrying out such horizontal actions and measures cannot be adequately attained by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better attained at Community level; whereas the proposed action does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the said objective;</p>
      <p n="33">(23) Whereas the implementation of the Agreement on the European Economic Area and the Association Agreements with the European Community requires a high degree of interoperability within and across the relevant telematic networks;</p>
      <p n="34">(24) Whereas there is an inherent international dimension to telematic networks and electronic communication;</p>
      <p n="35">(25) Whereas the measures aimed at ensuring the interoperability of telematic networks between administrations are in accordance with the priorities adopted in relation to the guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks;</p>
      <p n="36">(26) Whereas actions have been carried out under Council Decision 95/468/EC of 6 November 1995 on a Community contribution for telematic interchange of data between administrations in the Community (IDA)(11); whereas the Court of Justice annulled Decision 95/468/EC on 28 May 1998; whereas the effects of the measures taken by the Commission on the basis of this Decision before annulment by the Court are maintained;</p>
      <p n="37">(27) Whereas this Decision establishes a financial framework which should be the principal point of reference, within the meaning of point 1 of the Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995(12), for the budgetary authority for the purposes of the annual budgetary procedure,</p>
      <p n="38">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
