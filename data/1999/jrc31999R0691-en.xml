      <p n="6">Whereas the characteristics that set stained grains and spotted grains apart are very close and distinguishing one from another is often a delicate task when samples taken in accordance with Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 708/98 (3) are analysed; whereas those two criteria should therefore be combined and the relevant price reductions applying should be determined on the basis of grain defects covering both stained and spotted grains;</p>
      <p n="7">Whereas new varieties of rice are being grown in the Community; whereas they should be entered, with their milling yields, in the list in point B in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 708/98;</p>
