      <p n="2">REGULATION (EC) No 1655/1999 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL</p>
      <p n="3">of 19 July 1999</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 156 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Whereas experience with the application of Regulation (EC) No 2236/95(5) has demonstrated that a number of amendments need to be made thereto;</p>
      <p n="12">(2) Whereas it is necessary to facilitate the financing of certain projects by including, among the possible forms of aid, a contribution to the formation of risk capital; whereas it is desirable to use the financial resources provided under Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 in order to maximise the contribution from private finance;</p>
      <p n="13">(3) Whereas a layer of risk capital in the financial package of a project may contribute to putting public-private partnerships in trans-European network projects on their way; whereas the supply of risk capital for trans-European networks, particularly during their early stages, is limited;</p>
      <p n="14">(4) Whereas it is appropriate to allow risk capital participation in investment funds with a priority focus on providing risk capital for trans-European network projects up to 1 % of the overall amount for the period 2000 to 2006 in order to gain experience with this new form of financing; whereas this limit may be increased up to 2 % following a review of the functioning of this instrument; whereas it is also appropriate to examine its possible future extension;</p>
      <p n="15">(5) Whereas it is desirable, in order to increase transparency and to meet expectations for projects or groups of projects having important financial needs for a long period, that indicative multiannual programmes in specific sectors or fields should be drawn up; whereas those programmes should indicate the total and annual amount of support which could be allocated for a given period to such project or groups of projects, and which should serve as a reference for the annual decisions to grant financial aid within the yearly budgetary appropriations, when they conform to the relevant indicative multiannual programmes; whereas, however, the annual amounts indicated in these programmes do not amount to budgetary commitments;</p>
      <p n="16">(6) Whereas projects or groups of projects should be able to benefit from successive financial assistance decisions;</p>
      <p n="17">(7) Whereas, in the application for financial support for a project, a detailed breakdown of estimates is needed concerning the sources of contributions from the Community and from national, regional and local government bodies, as well as the extent of financial contributions from the private sector;</p>
      <p n="18">(8) Whereas financial aids granted should be cancelled except in duly justified cases if the actions concerned have not been started by a given date;</p>
      <p n="19">(9) Whereas it is necessary to include the activities of the European Investment Fund among the Community financial instruments with which action under Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 is required to be coordinated;</p>
      <p n="20">(10) Whereas the Commission should be able to require beneficiaries to provide evaluations of projects supported under Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 or the necessary information to allow the Commission to undertake its own evaluation;</p>
      <p n="21">(11) Whereas Council Decision 87/373/EEC(6) lays down the procedures for the exercise of powers conferred on the Commission by the Council for the implementation of acts which it adopts; whereas the procedures laid down in this Regulation should take account of possible modifications of existing arrangements laid down by interinstitutional agreement or by Decision 87/373/EEC;</p>
      <p n="22">(12) Whereas given the importance of the trans-European networks, it is appropriate to include in Regulation (EC) 2236/95 a financial framework within the meaning of point 1 of the Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995, of EUR 4600 million for its implementation for the period 2000 to 2006;</p>
      <p n="23">(13) Whereas it is appropriate that the Council examines whether to continue or to amend the measures under Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 in the light of the comprehensive report submitted by the Commission before the end of 2006;</p>
      <p n="24">(14) Whereas, throughout the transitional period from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001, all references to the euro should be read as references to the euro as a monetary unit as referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro(7);</p>
      <p n="25">(15) Whereas Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 should therefore be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="26">HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="27">Article 1</p>
      <p n="28">Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 is hereby amended as follows:</p>

      <p n="34">(a) co-financing of studies related to projects, including preparatory, feasibility and evaluation studies, and other technical support measures for these studies. Community participation may in general not exceed 50 % of the total cost of a study.</p>
      <p n="35">In exceptional, duly substantiated cases, at the initiative of the Commission and with the consent of the Member States concerned, Community participation may exceed the limit of 50 %;</p>
      <p n="36">(b) subsidies of the interest on loans granted by the European Investment Bank or other public or private financial bodies. As a general rule, the duration of subsidy shall not exceed five years;</p>
      <p n="37">(c) contributions towards fees for guarantees for loans from the European Investment Fund or other financial institutions;</p>
      <p n="38">(d) direct grants to investments in duly justified cases;</p>
      <p n="39">(e) risk-capital participation for investment funds or comparable financial undertakings with a priority focus on providing risk capital for trans-European network projects and involving substantial private-sector investment; such risk-capital participation shall not exceed 1 % of the budgetary resources under Article 18. In accordance with the procedure specified in Article 17, this limit may be increased up to 2 % as from 2003 in the light of a review, to be presented to the European Parliament and the Council by the Commission, of the functioning of this instrument.</p>
      <p n="40">Further modalities of implementation of this risk-capital participation are laid down in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="41">The participation may be made directly into the fund or comparable financial undertaking or into an appropriate coinvestment vehicle managed by the same fund managers;</p>
      <p n="42">(f) Community assistance under points (a) to (e) shall be combined where appropriate, in order to maximise the stimulus provided by the budgetary resources deployed, which shall be used in the most economical way.</p>
      <p n="43">2. The forms of Community aid referred to under points (a) to (e) shall be used selectively to take account of the specific characteristics of the various types of network involved and to ensure that such aid does not cause distortions of competition between undertakings in the sectorconcerned.</p>
      <p n="44">3. The funding for transport infrastructure projects throughout the period referred to in Article 18 should be used in such a way that at least 55 % is devoted to railways (including combined transport) and a maximum of 25 % to roads.</p>
      <p n="45">4. The Commission shall specifically promote recourse to private sources of financing for projects funded under this Regulation where the multiplier effect of Community financial instruments can be maximised in public-private partnerships. Each case shall be examined individually by the Commission, with account taken where appropriate of a possible alternative financed solely with public resources. The support of each member State concerned shall be required for each project in accordance with the Treaty."</p>
      <p n="46">4. In Article 5(3) the following subparagraph shall be inserted: "Exceptionally, in the case of projects concerning satellite positioning and navigation systems as provided for in Article 17 of Decision No 1692/96/EC(8), the total amount of Community aid under this Regulation may reach 20 % of the total, investment cost as from 1 January 2003 following a review."</p>
