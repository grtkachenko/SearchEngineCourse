      <p n="6">Whereas Article 11 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 124/1999 (4), lays down the time limit for processing and incorporating into final products the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation; whereas the current length of that time limit is likely to encourage operations of a speculative nature; whereas the time limit should therefore be reduced;</p>

      <p n="8">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
