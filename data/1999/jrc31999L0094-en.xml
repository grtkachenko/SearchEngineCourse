      <head n="1">Directive 1999/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars</head>
      <p n="2">DIRECTIVE 1999/94/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL</p>
      <p n="3">of 13 December 1999</p>
      <p n="4">relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Whereas Article 174 of the Treaty requires prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources; whereas the rational use of energy is one of the principal means by which this objective can be achieved and environmental pollution reduced;</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Whereas the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is to achieve stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system;</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Whereas under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed at the December 1997 Kyoto Conference, the Community has accepted the target of reducing its emissions during the period 2008 to 2012 in respect of a basket of greenhouse gases by 8 % relative to 1990 levels;</p>
      <p n="13">(4) Whereas in recognition of the importance of passenger cars as a source of CO2 emissions, the Commission has proposed a Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and to improve fuel economy; whereas in its Conclusions of 25 June 1996 the Council welcomed the Commission's approach;</p>
      <p n="14">(5) Whereas information plays a key role in the operation of market forces; whereas the provision of accurate, relevant and comparable information on the specific fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of passenger cars may influence consumer choice in favour of those cars which use less fuel and thereby emit less CO2, thereby encouraging manufacturers to take steps to reduce the fuel consumption of the cars that they manufacture;</p>
      <p n="15">(6) Whereas the presence of labels on used cars at the point of sale could influence buyers of new passenger cars towards low consumption cars, since this characteristic will be taken into account when the car is re-sold; whereas it is therefore appropriate, in connection with the first review of this Directive, to consider enlarging the scope to used cars covered by Commission Directive 93/116/EC of 17 December 1993 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 80/1268/EEC relating to the fuel consumption of motor vehicles(4);</p>
      <p n="16">(7) Whereas it is therefore necessary to develop a fuel economy label for all new passenger cars displayed at the point of sale;</p>
      <p n="17">(8) Whereas a fuel economy label should contain information on fuel consumption and specific emissions of CO2 that have been determined in accordance with the harmonised standards and methods laid down in Council Directive 80/1268/EEC of 16 December 1980 relating to the carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption of motor vehicles(5);</p>
      <p n="18">(9) Whereas it is necessary that supplementary standardised information on the fuel consumption and specific CO2 emissions of all versions on the new car market is available in a suitable form both at the point of sale and from a designated body in each Member State; whereas such information may be useful to consumers who formulate their purchase decision before entering the showroom or who choose not to use the services of a dealer or visit a showroom when purchasing a passenger car;</p>
      <p n="19">(10) Whereas it is important that potential customers are made aware, at the point of sale, of the most fuel efficient passenger car models available through that point of sale;</p>
      <p n="20">(11) Whereas all promotional literature, and, as appropriate, all other promotional material, used in the marketing of new passenger cars, should contain data on the relevant fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for the passenger car models to which it pertains,</p>
      <p n="21">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
