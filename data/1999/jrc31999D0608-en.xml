      <p n="2">COMMISSION DECISION</p>
      <p n="3">of 10 September 1999</p>
      <p n="4">amending Annexes of Council Directive 90/429/EEC laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the porcine species</p>

      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 90/429/EEC of 26 June 1990 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the porcine species(1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and, in particular, Article 17 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Whereas Directive 90/429/EEC requires a test for foot-and-mouth disease to be applied pending the introduction of a Community policy to combat foot-and-mouth disease; whereas this policy has been introduced and vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease ceased in 1991, and the test is no longer necessary;</p>
      <p n="12">(2) Whereas Directive 90/429/EEC requires tests to be carried out on animals as they leave the collection centre; whereas these tests may also be carried out effectively on resident animals according to a programme which ensures that a representative sample is tested regularly and that all are tested at least once per year;</p>
      <p n="13">(3) Whereas in the light of technical developments and experiences with the implementation of the Directive, it is opportune to amend the Annexes to allow for these developments, in particular regarding brucellosis;</p>
      <p n="14">(4) Whereas it is necessary to lay down conditions for trade of live boars intended to be used for production of semen, establishing additional guaranties to conditions provided by Directive 64/432/EEC(2) for trade of live animals of porcine species;</p>
      <p n="15">(5) Whereas it is necessary to provide for measures for trade of porcine semen to Member States or regions recognised as free of Aujeszky's disease in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC;</p>
      <p n="16">(6) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
      <p n="19">The Annexes A, B and C to Directive 90/429/EEC are replaced by the Annex to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">This Decision shall apply from 1 October 1999. It shall not apply to semen collected, processed and stored before 1 October 1999.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 3</p>
      <p n="23">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>

      <p n="60">ANNEX B</p>
      <p n="61">CHAPTER I</p>
      <p n="62">Conditions applying to the admission of animals to approved semen collection centres</p>
      <p n="63">1. All animals admitted to a semen collection centre must:</p>
      <p n="64">(a) have been subjected to a period of quarantine of at least 30 days in accommodation specifically approved for the purpose by the competent authority of the Member State, and where only animals having at least the same health status are present;</p>
      <p n="65">(b) prior to their entering the quarantine accommodation described in (a) have been chosen from herds or holdings:</p>
      <p n="66">- which are free of brucellosis in accordance with the Article 3.5.2.l of the International Animal Health Code,</p>
      <p n="67">- in which no animal vaccinated against foot and-mouth disease has been present in the preceding 12 months,</p>
      <p n="68">- in which no clinical, serological or virological evidence of Aujeszky's disease has been detected in the preceding 12 months,</p>
      <p n="69">- which are not situated in a restricted area defined under the provisions of the Community legislation due to the emergence of a disease in domestic pigs.</p>
      <p n="70">The animals may not previously have been kept in any herd of a lower status</p>
      <p n="71">(c) before the period of quarantine specified in (a) and within the previous 30 days, have been subjected to the following tests, performed in accordance with standards laid down in relevant Directives, with negative results:</p>
      <p n="72">- a complement fixation test or a buffered brucella antigen test in respect of brucellosis (from 1 January 2001, the buffered brucella antigen test will be the only authorised test),</p>
      <p n="73">- a serum neutralisation or an ELISA test using all the Aujeszky's disease viral antigens in the case of non-vaccinated pigs,</p>
      <p n="74">- or an ELISA test for Aujeszky's disease G1 antigens in the case of pigs vaccinated with a G1 deleted vaccine,</p>
      <p n="75">- an ELISA test or a serum neutralisation test for the presence of classical swine fever.</p>
      <p n="76">With regard to brucellosis, if animals should prove positive, animals with negative results in the same holding are admitted in the quarantine accommodation after the confirmation of the brucellosis free status of the herds or holdings of origin of the positive reactors.</p>
      <p n="77">The competent authority may give authorisation for the tests referred to in this paragraph to be carried out in the quarantine accommodation, provided that the results are known before the beginning of the 30 days quarantine period laid down in (a);</p>
      <p n="78">(d) during the last 15 days of the period of quarantine of at least 30 days specified in (a), have been subjected to the following tests with negative results;</p>
      <p n="79">- in respect of brucellosis, a complement fixation test or a buffered brucella antigen test (from the l January 2001 the buffered brucella antigen test will be the only authorised test),</p>
      <p n="80">- a serum neutralisation or an ELISA test using all the Aujeszky's disease viral antigens in the case of non-vaccinated pigs, or an ELISA test for Aujeszky's disease G1 antigens in the case of pigs vaccinated with a G1 deleted vaccine.</p>
      <p n="81">Without prejudice to the provisions applicable in cases where foot-and-mouth disease or other list A diseases are diagnosed, if any of the abovementioned tests should prove positive, the animal must be removed forthwith from the quarantine accommodation. In the case of group quarantine, the competent authority must take all necessary measures to ensure that the remaining animals have a satisfactory health status before being admitted to the collection centre in accordance with this Annex.</p>
      <p n="82">However, with regard to brucellosis when animals are positive, the following protocol is implemented:</p>
      <p n="83">(i) the positive sera are subjected to a sero-agglutination test as well as the test mentioned at the first indent above which has not been carried out,</p>
      <p n="84">(ii) an epidemiological survey is carried out on the holdings of origin of the reacting animals,</p>
      <p n="85">(iii) on the positive animals, a second series of tests (buffered brucella antigen test, sero-agglutination, complement fixation) is carried out on samples collected more than seven days after the first collection.</p>
      <p n="86">The suspicion of brucellosis will be confirmed or ruled out in the light of the results of the survey carried out on the holdings of origin and the comparison of the results of the two series of tests.</p>
      <p n="87">When the suspicion of brucellosis is ruled out, the animals negative to the first brucellosis test can be introduced into the centre. Animals positive to one test may be accepted if they answer negatively to two series of tests (buffered brucella antigen test, sero-agglutination, complement fixation) carried out with an interval of at least seven days.</p>
      <p n="88">2. All tests must be carried out in a laboratory approved by the Member State.</p>
      <p n="89">3. Animals may only be admitted to the semen collection centre with the express permission of the centre veterinarian. All animal movements, both in and out, must be recorded.</p>
