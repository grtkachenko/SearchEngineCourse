      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1498/1999 of 8 July 1999 laying down rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards communications between the Member States and the Commission in the milk and milk products sector</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1498/1999</p>
      <p n="3">of 8 July 1999</p>
      <p n="4">laying down rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards communications between the Member States and the Commission in the milk and milk products sector</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1587/96(2), and in particular Article 28 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">(1) Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 210/69 of 31 January 1969 on communications between Member States and the Commission with regard to milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 427/98(4), has been substantially amended several times; whereas, for the sake of clarity, that Regulation should be recast since further amendments are to be made;</p>
      <p n="9">(2) Whereas appraisal of the production and market situation in the milk and milk products sector necessitates a regular exchange of information on the operation of the intervention measures provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, particularly with regard to changes in stocks of the products concerned, both held by intervention agencies and in private storage;</p>
      <p n="10">(3) Whereas aid for skimmed milk processed into casein and refunds can be fixed only on the basis of information on changes in prices in international trade;</p>
      <p n="11">(4) Whereas the accurate and detailed monitoring of trade flows to assess the effect of refunds requires information on exports of products for which refunds are fixed, particularly the quantities awarded under tendering procedures;</p>
      <p n="12">(5) Whereas the implementation of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations(5) (hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement on Agriculture") requires additional and more detailed information to be provided on imports and exports, in particular with regard to licence applications and the way licences are used, in order to ensure compliance with undertakings under the Agreement; whereas rapid information on export trends is needed in order to make maximum use of those undertakings; whereas under that Agreement food-aid exports are not subject to the constraints applying to subsidised exports; whereas it should be provided that communications relating to export licence applications must accordingly specify which licence applications cover food-aid supplies;</p>
      <p n="13">(6) Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 147/1999(6) lays down detailed rules for exports of cheese to Canada, Switzerland and the United States; whereas provision should be made for the relevant information to be communicated;</p>
      <p n="14">(7) Whereas Regulation {EC) No 147/1999 introduces specific arrangements for the grant of refunds on ingredients of Community origin in processed cheese manufactured under the inward processing arrangements; whereas provision should be made for the relevant information to be communicated;</p>
      <p n="15">(8) Whereas Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 provides that, in certain cases, export licences can be valid for exportation of a product with a code other than that entered in Section 16 of the licence; whereas provision should be made for the relevant information to be communicated;</p>
      <p n="16">(9) Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1374/98(7), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1339/1999(8), provides for certain import quotas to be administered by means of IMA 1 certificates issued by the authorities of third countries; whereas the Member States inform the Commission of the quantity of products for which import licences are issued on the basis of IMA 1 certificates; whereas experience has shown that such notification is not always sufficient to allow such imports to be monitored closely at each stage; whereas provision should be made for additional information to be communicated;</p>
      <p n="17">(10) Whereas the method of communicating certain information should be changed; whereas the communication of that information is essential in order to monitor compliance with certain import quotas starting on 1 July 1999 under the Agreement on Agriculture; whereas, in order to ensure the continuity of the management of the system, it is accordingly necessary that this Regulation apply from that date;</p>
      <p n="18">(11) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,</p>
      <p n="19">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
