      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 857/1999(2), and in particular Article 48 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">(1) Whereas Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 lays down the conditions under which the rules issued by producer organisations or associations of such organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector may be extended to all producers established in a specific economic area; whereas detailed rules should be adopted for the implementation of that Article;</p>
      <p n="9">(2) Whereas Article 18(7) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 requires the list of economic areas to be forwarded to the Commission for approval; whereas the Commission must be able to assess the list in the light of Article 18(2);</p>
      <p n="10">(3) Whereas Article 18(1) of the abovementioned Regulation lays down certain conditions for the extension of rules; whereas Article 18(3) lays down the conditions that producer organisations and associations of such organisations must meet in order to be considered representative; whereas the Commission must be able to assess compliance with those conditions;</p>
      <p n="11">(4) Whereas, where the rules to be extended concern withdrawals, producers who do not belong to producer organisations should be able to carry out withdrawals;</p>
      <p n="12">(5) Whereas Article 18(6) of the abovementioned Regulation lays down the conditions under which financial contributions may be levied on producers who do not belong to producer organisations; whereas the Commission must be able to assess compliance with those conditions;</p>
      <p n="13">(6) Whereas, where produce is sold on the tree, it should be made clear which rules are to be extended to the producers and the buyers respectively;</p>
      <p n="14">(7) Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 2137/84(3) should be repealed;</p>
      <p n="15">(8) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,</p>

If they find that the conditions are no longer complied with, they shall immediately repeal the extension with effect from the beginning of the following marketing year.
