      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EC) No 307/1999 of 8 February 1999 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 with a view to extending them to cover students</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 307/1999 of 8 February 1999 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 with a view to extending them to cover students</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 51 and 235 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), submitted after consultation of the Administrative Commission on Social Security for Migrant Workers,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">(1) Whereas point (c) of Article 3 of the Treaty lays down that the activities of the Community shall include, as provided in the Treaty, the abolition, as between Member States, of obstacles to the free movement of persons;</p>
      <p n="9">(2) Whereas Article 7a of the Treaty provides that the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty;</p>
      <p n="10">(3) Whereas with a view to establishing the free movement of employed and self-employed persons and removing the obstacles that would, in the field of social security, result from the application of national legislation only, the Council, on the basis of Articles 51 and 235 of the Treaty, adopted Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and members of their families moving within the Community (4) and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 (5);</p>
      <p n="11">(4) Whereas, moreover, the scope of the Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 should be extended to include, in principle, the special schemes covering students;</p>
      <p n="12">(5) Whereas, in the social security field, the application of national legislation alone does not afford sufficient protection for students moving within the Community; whereas, in order to make the free movement of persons fully effective, the social security schemes applicable to them should be coordinated;</p>
      <p n="13">(6) Whereas, for reasons of equity, specific rules applicable to employed and self-employed persons should be applied to students; whereas those rules, for the sake of simplicity and clarity, should supplement the provisions already in force for employed and self-employed persons and members of their families;</p>
      <p n="14">(7) Whereas it is necessary to adapt Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and (EEC) No 574/72 as necessary for their provisions to apply to students moving within the Community, taking account of the specific situation of those persons, the special features of the schemes under which they are insured, and the benefits to which they are entitled;</p>
      <p n="15">(8) Whereas, although the specific nature of the situation relating to students may not have enabled rules to be laid down to determine which legislation is applicable, it is nevertheless desirable, as far as possible, to prevent the persons concerned from being subject to a double levy of contributions, or acquiring dual rights to benefits;</p>
      <p n="16">(9) Whereas the adaptations to be made to the enacting terms of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 require adaptation of Annex VI thereto;</p>
      <p n="17">(10) Whereas the specific situation of Luxembourg, where all students who study abroad are entitled to health care, justifies such students being automatically exempted from the requirement to join a health insurance scheme in the country in which they pursue their studies;</p>
      <p n="18">(11) Whereas, because of the specific situation of students, it has not been possible to set up a comprehensive system for the coordination of the social security rights of students at Community level, in particular in respect of invalidity benefits; whereas social security benefits available to students vary greatly between Member States particularly with regard to special non-contributory benefits designed to help towards the additional costs arising from the care and mobility needs of disabled people; whereas the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised that the detailed rules for granting certain benefits are closely linked to a particular economic and social context; whereas a limited derogation from the rules on the coordination of periods applied by Article 10a(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is therefore justified;</p>
      <p n="19">(12) Whereas the Treaty has not provided the necessary powers to take appropriate measures within the field of social security for students, and therefore having recourse to Article 235, in addition to Article 51, is justified;</p>
      <p n="20">(13) Whereas this Regulation applies without prejudice to the conditions laid down by Directive 93/96/EEC (6) for the right of residence for students,</p>
      <p n="21">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="22">Article 1</p>
      <p n="23">Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="24">1. Article 1 is hereby amended as follows:</p>

      <p n="42">Article 34b</p>
      <p n="43">Common provisions</p>
      <p n="44">A person, as referred to in Article 22(1) and (3) and in Article 34a, who stays in a Member State other than the competent State to study there or receive vocational training leading to a qualification officially recognised by the authorities of a Member State, and the members of his family accompanying him during his stay, shall be covered by the provisions of Article 22(1)(a) for any conditions necessitating benefits during the stay in the territory of the Member State where such person is studying or in training.`;</p>
      <p n="45">7. in Article 35(3), the words 'shall apply neither to employed or self-employed persons nor to the members of their families` shall be replaced by 'shall not apply to persons`;</p>
      <p n="46">8. in Chapter 4 of Title III, the following Section shall be added:</p>

      <p n="62">1. No rights shall be acquired under this Regulation by students, members of their families or their survivors for any period prior to 1 May 1999.</p>
      <p n="63">2. Any period of insurance and, where appropriate, any period of employment, self-employment or residence completed under the legislation of a Member State before 1 May 1999 shall be taken into account for the determination of rights acquired in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation.</p>

The Spanish special scheme for students ("Seguro Escolar") is not based, for the recognition of benefits, on completion of periods of insurance, employment and residence as those expressions are defined in Article 1(r), (s) and (sa) of the Regulation. The Spanish institutions cannot therefore issue the relevant certificates for the purposes of aggregating periods.</p>
      <p n="71">Nevertheless, the Spanish special scheme for students will apply to students who are nationals of other Member States and who are studying in Spain, under the same conditions as students of Spanish nationality.`;</p>
