      <p n="33">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="34">FRAMEWORK</p>
      <p n="35">In order to be awarded an eco-label, the portable computer shall comply with the criteria of this Annex, which are aimed at promoting:</p>
      <p n="36">- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of energy (global warming, acidification, depletion of non-renewable resources) by reducing energy consumption,</p>
      <p n="37">- the reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by encouraging the exchangeability of components, and the recyclability and maintainability of the computer,</p>
      <p n="38">- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of hazardous substances by reducing the use of such substances.</p>
      <p n="39">Additionally, the criteria encourage the implementation of best practice and enhance the environmental awareness of consumers.</p>
      <p n="40">Furthermore, the marking of plastic components encourages their recycling.</p>
      <p n="41">The Competent Bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex. (Note:</p>
      <p n="42">it is not required to implement such management schemes).</p>
      <p n="43">KEY CRITERIA</p>
      <p n="44">1. Energy savings</p>
      <p n="45">The portable computer shall have a maximum sleep-mode power consumption of 5 W.</p>
      <p n="46">The portable computer shall have a maximum off-mode power consumption of 3 W.</p>
      <p n="47">The default mode-change time from operation to sleep shall be &lt;= 15 minutes of inactivity. The manufacturer must enable this feature, but the user may disable it.</p>
      <p n="48">2. Lifetime extension</p>
      <p n="49">The manufacturer shall offer a commercial guarantee to ensure that the portable computer will function for at least three years. This guarantee shall be valid from the date of delivery to the customer.</p>
      <p n="50">The availability of compatible replacement parts and service shall be guaranteed for five years from the time of shipment.</p>
      <p n="51">In addition, the portable computer shall meet the following criteria.</p>
      <p n="52">1. It shall have a modular design, allowing components to be easily accessible.</p>
      <p n="53">2. Upgradability shall be ensured for the random access memory. Exchangeability shall be ensured for at least the processor, the hard disk and, if available, the CD-ROM drive. The processor may be exchanged by replacing the whole motherboard.</p>
      <p n="54">3. One or more empty slots shall be available.</p>
      <p n="55">BEST PRACTICE CRITERIA</p>
      <p n="56">3. Take-back and recycling</p>
