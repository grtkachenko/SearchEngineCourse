      <head n="1">Commission Directive 1999/100/EC of 15 December 1999 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 80/1268/EEC relating to the carbon dioxide emissions and the fuel consumption of motor vehicles (Text with EEA relevance)</head>
      <p n="2">COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 1999/100/EC</p>
      <p n="3">of 15 December 1999</p>
      <p n="4">adapting to technical progress Council Directive 80/1268/EEC relating to the carbon dioxide emissions and the fuel consumption of motor vehicles</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(1), as last amended by Directive 98/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 80/1268/EEC of 16 December 1980 relating to the carbon dioxide emissions and the fuel consumption of motor vehicles(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 93/116/EC(4), and in particular Article 3 thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Directive 80/1268/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval procedure which was established by Directive 70/156/EEC. Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) In Directive 98/69/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 13 October 1998 relating to measures to be taken against air pollution from motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/220/EEC(5), the type I test cycle for emission measurement was amended by abolishing the initial 40 seconds of engine idle time. It is necessary to align the test cycle for the measurement of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption in Directive 80/1268/EEC accordingly.</p>
      <p n="13">(3) With a view to the monitoring of CO2 emissions in the framework of the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions of passenger cars, it is appropriate to introduce into Directive 80/1268/EEC new technical requirements regarding the measurement of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption for the EC type-approval of gas-fuelled vehicles (LPG and NG). In this respect, it is appropriate to follow the technical requirements adopted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in its Regulation No 101(6).</p>
      <p n="14">(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">Annexes I and II to Directive 80/1268/EEC are hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">1. With effect from 1 January 2000, Member States may not, on grounds relating to the emission of carbon dioxide or to fuel consumption:</p>
      <p n="20">- refuse, in respect of any given type of motor vehicle, to grant EC type-approval pursuant to Article 4(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC, or</p>
      <p n="21">- refuse to grant national type-approval, or</p>
      <p n="22">- prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of vehicles pursuant to Article 7 of Directive 70/156/EEC</p>
      <p n="23">if the emission and consumption figures have been determined in accordance with the requirements of Directive 80/1268/EEC, as amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="24">2. With effect from 1 January 2000, for vehicles in category M1 as defined in Annex II, Section A, to Directive 70/156/EEC, except vehicles of which the maximum mass exceeds 2500 kg, and with effect from 1 January 2001 for vehicles in category M1 the maximum mass of which exceeds 2500 kg, Member States:</p>
      <p n="25">- shall no longer grant EC type-approval pursuant to Article 4(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC, and</p>
      <p n="26">- shall refuse to grant national type-approval, except where the provisions of Article 8(2) of Directive 70/156/EEC are invoked,</p>
      <p n="27">for a type of vehicle if the emission and consumption figures have not been determined in accordance with the requirements of Directive 80/1268/EEC, as amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="28">3. With effect from 1 January 2001, for vehicles in category M1 as defined in Annex II, Section A, to Directive 70/156/EEC, except vehicles of which the maximum mass exceeds 2500 kg, and with effect from 1 January 2002 for vehicles in category M1 the maximum mass of which exceeds 2500 kg, Member States:</p>
      <p n="29">- shall consider certificates of conformity which accompany new vehicles in accordance with the provisions of Directive 70/156/EEC to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7(1) of that Directive, and</p>
      <p n="30">- shall refuse the registration, sale and entry into service of new vehicles which are not accompanied by a certificate of conformity in accordance with Directive 70/156/EEC, except where the provisions of Article 8(2) of Directive 70/156/EEC are invoked,</p>
      <p n="31">if the emission and consumption figures have not been determined in accordance with the requirements of Directive 80/1268/EEC, as amended by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="32">Article 3</p>
      <p n="33">1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 1999. They shall forthwith inform the Commissin thereof.</p>
      <p n="34">When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Diective or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.</p>
      <p n="35">2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="36">Article 4</p>
      <p n="37">This Directive shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="38">Article 5</p>
      <p n="39">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="40">Done at Brussels, 15 December 1999.</p>
