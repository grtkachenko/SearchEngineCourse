      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(1), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEG(2), and in particular Article 20(3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) For quick understanding of Animo-messages, by Decision 93/70/EEC(3), as last amended by Decision 98/168/EC(4), the Commission specified the codes to be used for animals and animal products.</p>

      <p n="14">(3) By Decision 98/168/EC, the Commission amended Decision 93/70/EEC to supplement the codes used for trade in certain types of mammalian animal waste.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) In this respect, the amended codes for live animals and animal products have proved incomplete and the products lacking should be included.</p>
