      <p n="42">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="43">FRAMEWORK</p>
      <p n="44">The general requirements established by Regulation (EEC) No 880/92 on a Community eco-label award scheme and the specific criteria of this Annex shall apply for the awarding of an eco-label to detergents for dishwashers.</p>
      <p n="45">These criteria aim at promoting:</p>
      <p n="46">- the reduction of water pollution both by reducing the quantity of detergent used and by limiting the quantity of harmful ingredients,</p>
      <p n="47">- the minimisation of waste production by reducing the amount of primary packaging and promoting its re-usability and/or recyclability,</p>
      <p n="48">- the reduction of energy use by promoting low temperature detergents.</p>
      <p n="49">Additionally, the criteria enhance the consumers' environmental awareness.</p>
      <p n="50">1. FUNCTIONAL UNIT AND REFERENCE DOSAGE</p>
      <p n="51">1.1. Functional unit</p>
      <p n="52">The functional unit shall be the quantity of product required to wash 12 place settings with a standard soil (as defined by DIN or ISO standards).</p>
      <p n="53">1.2. Reference dosage</p>
      <p n="54">The dosage recommended by the manufacturer to consumers for normally soiled dishes and 12 place settings is taken as a reference dosage under standard conditions.</p>
      <p n="55">2. KEY CRITERIA</p>
      <p n="56">2.1. Ecological criteria on ingredients</p>
      <p n="57">Key parameters</p>
      <p n="58">The following parameters are considered:</p>
      <p n="59">- total chemicals,</p>
      <p n="60">- critical dilution volume, toxicity (CDVtox),</p>
      <p n="61">- phosphates (as STPP)(1),</p>
      <p n="62">- non-biodegradable organics (aerobic) (NBDO aerobic),</p>
      <p n="63">- non-biodegradable organics (anaerobic) (NBDO anaerobic),</p>
      <p n="64">Appendix II presents the definition of the parameters used in the calculations. These parameters are calculated and expressed as g/wash, or l/wash, where appropriate. They are aggregates and assessed as a whole, according to the approach presented in this document.</p>
      <p n="65">Scoring/weighting factors</p>
      <p n="66">The following table summarises the selected criteria, their exclusion hurdles, their weighting factors and the maximum achievable scoring result. The scoring system formulae to be used to calculate the score in respect of each criterion are presented in point 2.3.</p>

      <p n="68">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="69">Notes:</p>
      <p n="70">All values are expressed in g/wash, except the CDVtox, value which is expressed in l/wash.</p>
      <p n="71">Wfactor = weighting factor HEXCI. = hurdle.</p>
      <p n="72">2.2. Pass/fail level for awarding an eco-label</p>
      <p n="73">The sum of the scores related to the five criteria concerning the ingredients shall be equal to or greater than 26.</p>

      <p n="75">2.3. Calculations related to ecological criteria on ingredients</p>
      <p n="76">Detergent Ingredient database (DID-list)</p>
      <p n="77">Appendix I.A presents-the detergent ingredients database (DID-list) which shall be used for calculations concerning the ingredient criteria. Data on loading factor, toxicity, non-biodegradability (aerobic) non-biodegradability (anaerobic) are listed for the major ingredients in Appendix I.A and these data must be used for the calculation concerning these ingredients.</p>
      <p n="78">The criteria:</p>
      <p n="79">- total chemicals</p>
      <p n="80">- non biodegradable (aerobic/anaerobic)</p>
      <p n="81">- phosphates (as STPP)</p>
      <p n="82">are calculated for each ingredient by considering the dosage per wash, water content and mass percentage in the formulation and they are added up for each product formulation.</p>
      <p n="83">The criterion on critical dilution volume toxicity is calculated for each ingredient by the equation:</p>
      <p n="84">kfvtox</p>
      <p n="85">&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p>
      <p n="86">Procedure for the calculation of criteria and scores</p>

      <p n="97">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="98">New chemical additional ingredients</p>
      <p n="99">(a) In the case of new chemicals or additional ingredients which are not listed in the detergent ingredient database the approach described here in Appendix I.B shall be followed.</p>
      <p n="100">Experimental data have to be submitted by the applicant to the competent body.</p>
      <p n="101">The data on anaerobic biodegradability (ECETOC test No 28, June 1988) have to be provided.</p>
      <p n="102">All the available documentation has to be provided concerning the data which are presented on biodegradation, removal, long-term effects (NOEC data) on fish, daphina magna, algae.</p>
      <p n="103">The reference for the relevant tests shall be the appropriate Annexes to Council Directive 67/518/EEC(2)</p>
      <p n="104">The provisions of Appendix I.B. shall apply, as appropriate.</p>
      <p n="105">In particular, if complete data concerning long-term effects (NOEC) are not available, the relevant simplified procedures described in Appendix I.B may be applied.</p>
      <p n="106">(b) A different approach may be followed if it is recognised by the Commission to be equivalent to the one referred to above, for the specific objectives of assessing compliance with the relevant criteria, at the request of a competent body or an interest group represented in the eco-label Consultation Forum (Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 880/92).</p>
      <p n="107">2.4. Other ecological criteria related to ingredients</p>
      <p n="108">Certain specific ingredients shall not exceed a maximum content in the detergent formulation or are excluded as specified below:</p>
      <p n="109">(a) the surfactant alkylphenothoxylate (APEO), the perfumes containing the aromatic nitro compounds referred to in Appendix Il, the complex formation agent EDTA and ingredients(3) classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic as defined in Directives 67/548/EEC and 88/379/EEC are excluded;</p>
      <p n="110">(b) phosphonates shall not exceed 0,2 g/wash;</p>

      <p n="116">4. TESTING</p>
      <p n="117">4.1. Test on purity of enzymes to verify the absence of production organisms</p>
      <p n="118">A test on the purity of enzymes has to be performed on enzymes that are produced by biotechnological processes and used in detergents for dishwashers applying for the eco-label. It is the aim of this test to ensure that production organisms are not contained in the final enzyme preparation.</p>
      <p n="119">The growth of micro-organisms is tested together with specific antibiotics. The test procedure on purity must ensure that no production organism is detected in a 20 ml standard test sample of the final enzyme product.</p>
      <p n="120">4.2. Testing laboratories</p>
      <p n="121">The testing shall be performed at the expense of the applicant by laboratories that meet the general requirements laid out in the EN 45001 standards or any equivalent systems.</p>
      <p n="122">5. CONSUMER INFORMATION</p>
      <p n="123">5.1. Information on the packaging</p>
      <p n="124">The following information shall appear on the product:</p>

      <p n="128">- wash full loads,</p>
      <p n="129">- do not exceed the recommended dosage,</p>
      <p n="130">- this will minimise both energy and water consumption and reduce water pollution"..</p>
      <p n="131">"This product has been awarded the European Union eco-label because it helps to reduce water pollution, waste production and energy consumption".</p>
      <p n="132">For more information about the European Union eco-label, contact the European Commission: Internet: http://europa.eu.int/ecolabel By post: European Commission DG XI E4 Rue de la Loi 200 , B - 1049 Bruxelles / Westraat 200 , B - 1049 Brussel.</p>
      <p n="133">5.2. Dosage instructions.</p>
      <p n="134">Dosage instructions shall appear on the product packages. The recommended dosages must be specified for "normally" and "heavily" soiled dishes. The instructions shall specify how to make best use of the product according to the soil.</p>
      <p n="135">5.3. Information and labelling of ingredients</p>
      <p n="136">Commission Recommendation 89/542/EEC of 13 September 1989 concerning the labelling of detergents and cleaning agents(5) must be applied:</p>

      <p n="146">Appendix I</p>
      <p n="147">DETERGENT INGREDIENTS DATABASE AND APPROACH TO BE FOLLOWED FOR INGREDIENTS NOT LISTED IN THE DATABASE</p>
      <p n="148">A. The data given below on the most commonly used detergent ingredients are to be used for the calculation of the ecological criteria (see following table):</p>
      <p n="149">DETERGENT INGREDIENTS DATABASE</p>
      <p n="150">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="151">Notes:</p>
      <p n="152">Y= Yes</p>
      <p n="153">CF= Correction factor, to be applied to the dosage Expressed in g/wash</p>
      <p n="154">0= not to be used</p>
      <p n="155">NOEC= Non-observed measured concentration</p>
      <p n="156">LTE= Ong-term effect</p>
      <p n="157">THOD= Theoretical oxygen demand</p>
      <p n="158">B. The following approach applies, as appropriate in the case of ingredients that are not listed on the DID-list</p>
      <p n="159">Aquatic toxicity</p>
      <p n="160">The lowest validated long-term effect (LTE) data on fish, daphnia magna or algae should be considered for the calculation of the critical dilution volume criterion (toxicity).</p>
      <p n="161">In cases where data on homologues and/or QSARs (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) are used, a correction could be considered for the finally selected LTE data.</p>
      <p n="162">In the absence of LTE data the following procedure has to be applied in order to estimate the LTE data by using the specified uncertainty factor (UF) on the data of the most sensitive species:</p>
      <p n="163">Non-surfactants</p>
      <p n="164">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="165">Deviation from this rule may be admitted if evidence can be provided that lower factors or data can be scientifically justified.</p>
      <p n="166">Surfactants</p>
      <p n="167">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="168">In the last case referred to above, an uncertainty factor of 20 may be used instead of 50 only if 1-2 L(E)C50 (LC50 in case of fish toxicity, EC50 in case of daphnia or algal toxicity) data are available and if it can be concluded from the information for other compounds that the most sensitive species have been tested. Such a rule can be applied only within a group of homologues. It should be emphasised that the LTEs (long-term effects) used must be consistent within a group of homologues with respect to the influence of length of alkyl chain for LAS (linear alkylbenzene sulphonate) or number of EOs (ethoxy groups) for alcohol-ethoxylate if such QSARs can be established.</p>
      <p n="169">Any deviation from the above described scheme has to be well-reasoned for the specific chemical.</p>
      <p n="170">Loading factors</p>
      <p n="171">Loading factors shall be established according to Commission Directive 93/67/EEC of 20 July 1993 laying down the principles for assessment of risk to man and the enviroment of substances notified in accordance with Council Directive 67/548/EEC(1) and to Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93(2)</p>
