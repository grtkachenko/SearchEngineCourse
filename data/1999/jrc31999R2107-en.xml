      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Under Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92, Ireland, Spain and Italy have sent the Commission applications for the registration of names as designations of origin or geographical indications;</p>

      <p n="11">(3) Several statements of objection have been received by the Commission under Article 7 of that Regulation in respect of the name "Imokilly Regato", following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3).

No statements of objection have been submitted under that Article in respect of the other names following their publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities(4);</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The names should therefore be entered in the "Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications" and hence be protected throughout the Community as protected designations of origin or protected geographical indications;</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The Annex to this Regulation supplements the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2400/96(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1645/1999(6),</p>

      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
