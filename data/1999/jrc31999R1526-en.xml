      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1526/1999</p>
      <p n="3">of 13 July 1999</p>
      <p n="4">determining the percentage of quantities covered by applications for export licences for pigmeat which may be accepted</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1370/95 of 16 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the pigmeat sector(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1719/98(2), and in particular Article 3(4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">(1) Whereas Regulation (EC) No 1370/95 provides for specific measures where applications for export licences concern quantities and/or expenditure which exceed the normal trade patterns or where there is a risk that they will be exceeded, taking account of the limit referred to in Article 8(11) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2916/95(4), and/ or the corresponding expenditure during the period in question;</p>
      <p n="9">(2) Whereas uncertainty is a feature of the market in certain pigmeat products; whereas the impending adjustment of the refunds applicable to those products has led to the submission of applications for export licences for export licences for speculative ends; whereas there is a risk that the issue of licences for the quantities applied for from 5 to 9 and from 12 to 13 July 1999 may lead to an overrun in the quantities of the products concerned normally disposed of by way of trade; whereas applications covering the products concerned,</p>
      <p n="10">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="11">Article 1</p>
      <p n="12">No further action shall be taken in respect of applications submitted until 13 July 1999 for export licences for pigmeat pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1370/95 in respect of categories 1, 2 and 3 of Annex I to that Regulation which should have been issued from 14 July and from 21 July 1999.</p>
      <p n="13">Article 2</p>
      <p n="14">This Regulation shall enter into force on 14 July 1999.</p>
      <p n="15">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="16">Done at Brussels, 13 July 1999.</p>
