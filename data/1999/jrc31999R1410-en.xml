      <p n="2">COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1410/1999</p>
      <p n="3">of 29 June 1999</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture and amending the definition of certain operative events provided for in Regulations (EEC) No 3889/87, (EEC) No 3886/92, (EEC) No 1793/93, (EEC) No 2700/93 and (EC) No 293/98</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing the agrimonetary arrangements for the euro(1), and in particular Articles 3(2) and 9 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">(1) Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 3516/93 of 20 December 1993 establishing the operative events for the conversion rates to be applied when calculating certain amounts provided for by the mechanisms of the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products(2), defines the operative events for fisheries; whereas, in the interests of transparency and clarity, the reference to fishery products in the definition of operative events in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailes rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture(3) should be deleted;</p>
      <p n="9">(2) Whereas Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 defines the operative events for the exchange rate in the case of aid per hectare and amounts of a structural or environmental character; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3889/87 of 22 December 1987 laying down detailed rules for the application of the special measures for certain regions of hops production(4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 718/93(5), defines the operative event for the exchange rate applicable to the payment of special aid; whereas Article 53 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3886/92 of 23 December 1992 laying down detailed rules for the application of the premium schemes provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1244/82 and (EEC) No 714/89(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2604/98(7), defines the operative events for the exchange rate for premiums in the beef and veal sector; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1793/93 of 30 June 1993 regarding the operative event for the agricultural conversion rates used in the hops sector(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2404/97(9), defines the operative event for the exchange rate applicable to the hops sector; whereas Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2700/93 of 30 September 1993 on detailed rules for the application of the premium in favour of sheepmeat and goatmeat producers(10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1526/96(11), defines the operative events for the exchange rate for premiums in the sheepmeat sector; whereas Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 293/98 of 4 February 1998 determing the operative events applicable to products in the fruit and vegetables sector, to processed fruit and vegetable products and partly to live plants and floricultural products and to certain products listed in Annex II to the EC Treaty, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1445/93(12) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 999/1999(13), defines the operative event for the exchange rate for aid to improve the quality and marketing of nuts and locust beans;</p>
      <p n="10">(3) Whereas the exchange rate on the date of the operative event for the aids, premiums and amounts referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 is defined as the rate on a given date; whereas the rate applicable on the date of the operative event should be amended to ensure in principle that such aids, premiums and amounts do not undergo any sharp fluctuations on conversion into national currency due to the exchange rate on a single date; whereas, to that end, the best solution appears to be an average of the exchange rates applicable during the month preceeding the operative event, calculated pro rata temporis;</p>
