      <p n="3">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3367/87</p>
      <p n="4">of 9 November 1987</p>
      <p n="5">on the application of the Combined Nomenclature to the statistics of trade between Member States and amending Regulation (EEC) No 1736/75 on the external trade statistics of the Community and statistics of trade between its Member States</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (3) established a nomenclature of goods known as the 'Combined Nomenclature' (CN) which, inter alia, meets the requirements of the Community's system of external trade statistics; whereas the Combined Nomenclature is applied by the Community and its Member States to these statistics;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas it is advisable, in particular for reasons of comparability, that the external trade statistics of the Community and the statistics of trade between Member States be compiled using the same nomenclature; whereas it is therefore necessary that the Community and its Member States also apply the Combined Nomenclature to the latter statistics;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the application of the Combined Nomenclature both to the external trade statistics of the Community and to the statistics of trade between Member States renders nugatory Council Regulation (EEC) No 1445/72 of 24 April 1972 concerning the nomenclature of goods for the external trade statistics of the Community and statistics of trade between Member States (NIMEXE) (4); whereas the said Regulation should therefore be repealed;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the repeal of Regulation (EEC) No 1445/72 must be accompanied by the adaptation of certain provisions in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1736/75 of 24 June 1975 on the external trade statistics of the Community and statistics of trade between Member States (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3396/84 (6);</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas it is appropriate to allow Member States to create national statistical subdivisions;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas it is appropriate that steps be taken at the same time to lay down the Member States's obligations regarding the breakdown, in accordance with the integrated customs tariff of the European Communities (TARIC) established under Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, of the statistics which they forward to the Commission on their imports from non-member countries,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

They shall, in compliance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2793/86 of 22 July 1986 laying down the codes to be used in the forms laid down in Council Regulations (EEC) No 678/85, (EEC) No 1900/85 and (EEC) No 222/77 (7), accompany these subdivisions with identifying number codes by means of a ninth digit reserved for the purpose.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>

      <p n="25">2. The goods must be described in accordance with paragraph 1, even when other Community regulations require them to be described at the same time in accordance with other nomenclatures.</p>
