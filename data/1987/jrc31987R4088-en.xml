      <p n="2">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 4088/87 of 21 December 1987 fixing conditions for the application of preferential customs duties on imports of certain flowers originating in Cyprus, Israel and Jordan</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Whereas the additional Protocols to the Association or Cooperation Agreements between the European Economic Community, on the one hand, and Cyprus, Israel and Jordan, on the other, provide that preferential customs duties shall be applied to imports into the Community of roses and carnations, within the limit of tariff quotas opened for imports of all fresh cut flowers falling within subheading 0603 10 of the combined nomenclature and originating in the said States; whereas these tariff advantages are applicable only to imports which comply with certain price conditions; Whereas this Regulation should state the price conditions with which imports of roses and carnations must comply in order to qualify for the application of preferential customs duties and should also set both the conditions for suspending the preferential tariff arrangement when these conditions are no longer met and the conditions for its subsequent reintroduction; Whereas price conditions to be complied with for imported products are determined according to Community producer prices; whereas, in the light of the extremely volatile and short-term fluctuations in the prices of the products in question in the Community, these producer prices should be set for two-week periods, on the basis of the average representative market price during the previous three years, excessive fluctuations being disregarded, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

The preferential customs duty shall be reintroduced for a given product of a given origin if the prices of the imported product (full-rate customs duty not deducted) are, in respect of a least 70 % of the quantities for which prices are available on representative Community import markets, equal to, or more than, 85 % of the Community producer price for a period, calculated from the actual date of suspension of preferential customs duty,- of two successive market days, after suspension under paragraph 2 (a),-of three successive market days, after suspension under paragraph 2 (b).In the absence of available price quotations, the preferential customs duty shall be reintroduced if there are no prices for six successive working days from the date the measure was applied. 4.

      <p n="11">On the basis of information given to it periodically by Member States or information which it has itself collected, the Commission shall keep a regular check on the trends both of the price of imports from each country of origin on the import markets and of producer prices on Community markets.</p>
