      <p n="6">Considering that so far as the Member States of the European Economic Community are concerned, the undertaking to grant this exemption falls within the competence of the Community, which possesses the necessary powers in this respect by virtue of the Treaty which instituted it;</p>
      <p n="7">Considering therefore that for the purpose of the implementation of Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Agreement, it is necessary for the European Economic Community to be able to become a Contracting Party to the Agreement,</p>

      <p n="13">2. However, this Additional Protocol shall enter into force on the expiration of a period of two years from the date on which it has been opened for acceptance, unless one of the Contracting Parties has notified an objection to the entry into force. If such an objection has been notified, paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply.</p>
      <p n="14">Article 3</p>
      <p n="15">From the date of its entry into force, this Additional Protocol shall form an integral part of the Agreement From that date, no State may become a Contracting Party to the Agreement without at the same time becoming a Contracting Party to the Additional Protocol.</p>
      <p n="16">Article 4</p>
      <p n="17">The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe shall notify the member States of the Council of Europe, any State having acceded to the Agreement and the European Economic Community of any acceptance o objection made under Article 2 and of the date of entry into force of this Additional Protocol in accordance with Article 2.</p>
      <p n="18">The Secretary-General shall also notify the European Economic Community of any act, notification o communication relating to the Agreement.</p>
