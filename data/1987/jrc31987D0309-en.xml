      <p n="12">Whereas that system has proved to be useful;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it is now desirable to grant a similar authorization, under the same conditions, in respect of field pea and field bean;</p>

      <p n="19">(a) the prescribed information shall be printed or stamped indelibly on the package;</p>
      <p n="20">(b) the lay-out and the colour of the printing or the stamp shall be in accordance with the model for the label used in the Member State concerned;</p>
      <p n="21">(c) of the prescribed information, at least that required under Annex IV (A) (a) (3), (3a) and (6) to Directive 66/401/EEC shall be printed or stamped when samples are taken pursuant to Article 7 (2) of the Directive, the printing or stamping being done officially or under official supervision;</p>
      <p n="22">(d) in addition to the prescribed information, each package shall have an officially attributed individual serial number which shall have been printed or stamped indelibly on it by the package printing firm; that firm shall inform the certification authority of the quantities of packages issued, including their serial numbers;</p>
      <p n="23">(e) the certification authority shall keep records of the quantities of seed thus marked, including the number and contents of the packages of each lot, as well as the serial numbers referred to under (d);</p>
      <p n="24">(f) producers' records shall be subject to supervision by the certification authority.</p>
