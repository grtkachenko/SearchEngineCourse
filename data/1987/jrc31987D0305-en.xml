      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas a real and effective opening-up of public procurement throughout the Community constitutes a priority objective for the Community as regards the completion of the internal market by 1992;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the achievement of this objective implies that it is necessary for the Commission better to assess the economic, technical, legal and social realities of public procurement and for the interested parties to have a better grasp of the problems involved in applying the Community rules in this area;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas close and continuous contact with the economic interests operating in the field of public procurement for supplies, works and services may contribute to this achievement;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the most appropriate method of organizing these contacts is to set up, under the auspices of the Commission, an advisory committee in which these interests are represented; whereas it is moreover appropriate to provide for the presence in this committee of pasrticularly well-qualified persons capable of bringing their general knowledge of public procurement to bear at Community level,</p>

      <p n="17">The committee's task shall be to assist the Commission, either at the Commission's request or on its own initiative, in assessing the economic, technical, legal and social aspects of public procurement.

      <p n="41">In such cases, only the members of the committee and the representatives of the Commission departments shall attend the meetings.</p>
      <p n="42">Article 12</p>
