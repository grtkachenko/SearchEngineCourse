      <p n="55">( Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community )</p>
      <p n="56">Notice pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 93 ( 2 ) of the EEC Treaty to interested parties , other than the Member States , concerning the proposal to award a regional development premium to a textile firm establishing a plant at La Chapelle St Luc ( Aube )</p>
      <p n="57">1 . The French Government has informed the Commission that it is proposing to award a regional development premium to a firm establishing a plant for manufacturing adult knitwear at La Chapelle St Luc ( Aube ) .</p>
      <p n="58">The total cost of the project , expected to create 125 jobs , is FF 31 600 000 , towards which the Government would pay a grant of FF 948 000 .</p>
      <p n="59">2 . The Commission has decided to open the procedure provided for by Article 93 ( 2 ) of the Treaty in respect of the proposal .</p>
      <p n="60">It considers that the aid could affect intra-Community trade in a sub-section of the textile industry in which there is already surplus production capacity . The Troyes area does not suffer from real regional problems , and in any case investment in this particular sub-sector is unlikely to assist regional development .</p>
      <p n="61">3 . The Commission hereby gives notice pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 93 ( 2 ) of the Treaty to all interested parties , other than the Member States , to submit their comments on the case within four weeks of the date of this notice to :</p>
