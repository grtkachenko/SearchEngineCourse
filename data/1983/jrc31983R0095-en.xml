      <p n="10">Whereas the monetary compensatory amounts introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 974/71 were fixed by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1235/82 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 88/83 (4);</p>

      <p n="16">'3. However, the coefficients 0;30 and 0;53 shall continue to apply, on application by dealers, in respect of quantities of products for which evidence is produced that the skimmed-milk powder was bought before 3 November 1982.'</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="19">It shall apply from 20 December 1982.</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
