      <p n="11">Whereas provision should be made for a system of certificates to accompany the said cheeses so that the competent authorities in the country of destination can speed up customs clearance; whereas steps should be taken to ensure that a higher refund than that provided for in the case of exports to Australia is not granted;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="26">3. After endorsement, originals and copies of certificates shall be returned to the party concerned.</p>
      <p n="27">4. Where a check is requested a posteriori by the competent authorities in the country of destination, the issuing agency shall inform them as soon as possible of the result.</p>

      <p n="30">2. No export refund exceeding the rate laid down for exports of cheeses to Australia may be granted where the document used to obtain the refund when the cheese is cleared by customs for export gives Australia as the country of destination.</p>
