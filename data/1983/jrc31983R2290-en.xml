      <p n="46">TITLE II</p>
      <p n="47">SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE ADMISSION FREE OF IMPORT DUTIES OF EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC OR CULTURAL MATERIALS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 51 OF THE BASIC REGULATION</p>
      <p n="48">Article 4</p>
      <p n="49">In order to obtain admission free of import duties of goods in accordance with Article 51 of the basic Regulation, the head of the establishment or organization to which the goods are consigned, or his authorized representative, must submit an application to the competent authority of the Member State in which the establishment or organization is situated.</p>
      <p n="50">Such application must be accompanied by all information which the competent authority considers necessary for the purpose of determining whether the conditions laid down for granting admission free of import duties are fulfilled.</p>
      <p n="51">TITLE III</p>
      <p n="52">SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE IMPORTATION FREE OF IMPORT DUTIES OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS UNDER ARTICLES 52, 54 AND 55 OF THE BASIC REGULATION</p>
      <p n="53">Article 5</p>
      <p n="54">1. For the purposes of the first indent of Article 54 of the basic Regulation, the objective technical characteristics of a scientific instrument or apparatus shall be understood to mean those characteristics resulting from the construction of that instrument or apparatus or from adjustments to a standard instrument or apparatus which make it possible to obtain high-level performances above those normally required for industrial or commercial use.</p>
      <p n="55">Where it is not possible to establish clearly on the basis of its objective technical characteristics whether an instrument or apparatus is to be regarded as a scientific instrument or apparatus, reference shall be made to the general uses in the Community of instruments or apparatus of the type for which admission free of import duties is requested. If this examination shows that the instrument or apparatus in question is used mainly for scientific purposes, it shall be deemed to be of a scientific nature.</p>
      <p n="56">2. In making the comparison provided for in the third indent of Article 54 of the basic Regulation, only such technical characteristics as have a decisive influence on the outcome of the specific work planned may be regarded as 'essential'.</p>
      <p n="57">The following, in particular, shall not be taken into account in making this comparison:</p>
      <p n="58">- the technical conception of an instrument or apparatus,</p>
      <p n="59">- the fact that an instrument or apparatus is able to achieve performances superior to those which are necessary for a proper execution of the specific work to be carried out,</p>
      <p n="60">- the external appearance of an instrument or apparatus,</p>
      <p n="61">- its commercial value,</p>
      <p n="62">- the servicing intervals,</p>
      <p n="63">- any after-sales service that may be provided.</p>
      <p n="64">Article 6</p>
      <p n="65">1. In order to obtain admission free of import duties of a scientific instrument or apparatus under the provisions of Article 52 (1) of the basic Regulation, the head of the establishment or organization to which the goods are consigned, or his authorized representative, must submit an application to the competent authority of the Member State in which the establishment or organization is situated.</p>
      <p n="66">2. The application referred to in paragraph 1 must contain the following information relating to the instrument or apparatus in question: (a) the precise trade description of the instrument or apparatus used by the manufacturer, its presumed Common Customs Tariff classification and the objective technical characteristics on the basis of which the instrument or apparatus is considered to be scientific;</p>
      <p n="67">(b) the name or business name and address of the manufacturer and, if available, of the supplier;</p>
      <p n="68">(c) the country of origin of the instrument or apparatus;</p>
      <p n="69">(d) the place where the instrument or apparatus is to be used;</p>
      <p n="70">(e) the use for which the instrument or apparatus is intended;</p>
      <p n="71">(f) a detailed description of the project for which the instrument or apparatus is to be used;</p>
      <p n="72">(g) the price of the instrument or apparatus or its value for customs purposes;</p>
      <p n="73">(h) the estimated delivery period;</p>
      <p n="74">(i) the date when the instrument or apparatus was ordered if it has already been ordered;</p>
      <p n="75">(j) the name or business name and address of the Community firm or firms which have been approached with a view to the supply of an instrument or apparatus of a scientific value equivalent to that for which admission free of import duties is requested, the outcome of these approaches and, where appropriate, detailed reasons why an instrument or apparatus which is available in the Community would not be suitable for the particular scientific work to be undertaken.</p>
      <p n="76">Documentary evidence providing all relevant information on the characteristics and technical specifications of the instrument or apparatus must be furnished with the application.</p>
      <p n="77">Article 7</p>
      <p n="78">1. The competent authority of the Member State in which is situated the establishment or organization to which the goods are consigned shall take a direct decision on applications under Article 6 in all cases where the information at its disposal, if necessary after consultation with the trade circles concerned, enables it to assess whether or not the instrument or apparatus is scientific and whether or not there exist instruments or apparatus of equivalent scientific value which are currently manufactured in the Community.</p>
      <p n="79">2. Where the competent authority of the Member State in which is situated the establishment or organization to which the goods are consigned is unable to take a decision as provided in paragraph 1, the application, with the relevant technical documents, shall be forwarded to the Commission in order to enable the latter to commence the procedure prescribed in paragraphs 3 to 7.</p>
      <p n="80">Pending the completion of that procedure, the competent authority may authorize the provisional importation free of import duties of the instrument or apparatus concerned, subject to an undertaking by the establishment or organization to which the goods are consigned to pay the relevant import duties should admission free of import duties not be granted.</p>
      <p n="81">The competent authority may make such provisional importation free of import duties conditional on the provision of security on terms to be laid down by it.</p>
      <p n="82">3. Within two weeks of the date of receipt of the application, the Commission shall dispatch a copy to each of the other Member States together with the relevant documentation.</p>
      <p n="83">4. If, on the expiry of a period of three months from the date of such dispatch, no Member State has sent the Commission objections concerning the admission free of import duties of the instrument or apparatus under consideration, the said instrument or apparatus shall be deemed to fulfil the conditions required for admission free of import duties. The Commission shall notify the Member State concerned of this decision within two weeks following the expiry of the aforesaid period. This notification shall, as soon as possible, be published, where necessary in an abbreviated form, in the Official Journal of the European Communities, C series.</p>
      <p n="84">5. If, within the period of three months laid down in paragraph 4, a Member State has sent the Commission objections regarding the importation free of import duties of the instrument or apparatus under consideration, the Commission shall as soon as possible notify a group of experts composed of representatives of all the Member States, who shall meet within the framework of the Committee on Duty-Free Arrangements in order to examine the matter.</p>
      <p n="85">The objections referred to in the preceding subparagraph must include a statement of the grounds therefor. Such grounds must indicate either why the instrument or apparatus concerned should not be regarded as being scientific, or should indicate precisely the instruments or apparatus manufactured in the Community which are regarded as having a scientific value equal to that for which admission free of import duties is requested, with the name or business name and address of the Community firm or firms who can supply them. In the latter case, the technical literature relating to the instruments or apparatus under consideration manufactured in the Community should be forwarded to the Commission as soon as possible.</p>
      <p n="86">The Commission shall transmit this information to the Member States as soon as it is received.</p>
      <p n="87">6. Where the examination undertaken in accordance with paragraph 5 shows that the instrument or apparatus for which admission free of import duties has been requested must be regarded as being scientific and that instruments or apparatus of equivalent scientific value are currently not manufactured in the Community, the Commission shall adopt a decision declaring that the said instrument or apparatus fulfils the conditions required for admission free of import duties. Where this examination shows that the instrument or apparatus for which admission free of import duties has been requested is not to be regarded as scientific, or that there is an instrument, or apparatus of equivalent scientific value currently manufactured in the Community, the Commission shall adopt a decision declaring that the said instrument or apparatus does not fulfil the conditions required for admission free of import duties.</p>
      <p n="88">The Commission decision shall be notified to the Member State concerned within two weeks. This decision shall, as soon as possible, be published, if necessary in abbreviated form, in the Official Journal of the European Communities, C series.</p>
      <p n="89">7. If, on the expiry of a period of six months from the date on which the application was received by the Commission, the latter has not adopted any decision under paragraph 6, the instrument or apparatus in question shall be deemed to fulfil the conditions required for admission free of import duties.</p>
      <p n="90">Article 8</p>
      <p n="91">Authorizations for admission free of import duties shall be valid for a period of six months.</p>
      <p n="92">The competent authorities may, however, set a longer period in the light of the particular circumstances of each case.</p>
      <p n="93">TITLE IV</p>

      <p n="98">It must also include:</p>
      <p n="99">(a) the name or business name and address of the donor;</p>
      <p n="100">(b) a declaration by the applicant that the instruments or apparatus for which admission free of import duties is requested are in fact being offered to the establishment or organization concerned without a reciprocal commercial concession of any kind, in particular without any publicity being involved.</p>
      <p n="101">Article 10</p>

      <p n="103">2. The competent authority shall authorize admission free of import duties of the instruments or apparatus under consideration only if it has been established that the donor is not deriving any direct or indirect commercial advantage from his gift to the establishment or organization to which the goods are consigned.</p>
      <p n="104">3. Where the competent authority of the Member State in which is situated the establishment or organization to which the goods are consigned is unable to decide on the basis of information at its disposal whether or not the instrument or apparatus for which admission free of import duties has been requested should be regarded as scientific, the procedure laid down in Article 7 (2) to (7) shall apply.</p>
      <p n="105">Article 11</p>
      <p n="106">The provisions of Articles 9 and 10 shall apply mutatis mutandis to tools for the maintenance, control, calibration and repair of scientific instruments or apparatus which have been admitted free of import duties under Article 56 of the basic Regulation.</p>
