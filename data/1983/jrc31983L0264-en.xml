      <head n="1">Council Directive 83/264/EEC of 16 May 1983 amending for the fourth time Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations</head>
      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 16 May 1983 amending for the fourth time Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (83/264/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the use of tris (2,3 dibromopropyl)-phosphate to fireproof textile articles was prohibited by Directive 79/663/EEC (4) because of the health hazards it presents ; whereas subsequent examinations have shown that two other fire-retardant products, tris-(aziridinyl)-phosphinoxide and polybrominatedbiphenyls (PBB), are harmful to health and, consequently, should not be employed in textile articles which come into contact with the skin;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas 3,3 dimethoxybenzidine is used in the manufacture of sneezing powder ; whereas, even though the information concerning the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of this substance is not conclusive, the affinity of the structure of this substance to benzidine, which has a definitely established carcinogenic effect on man, suggests that great caution should be exercized in respect of its potential risks to health ; whereas it is clear that sneezing powder is mainly used by children who, in principle, represent a group which is sensitive to toxic chemicals and who should, consequently, receive special protection against health hazards ; whereas, therefore, the use of this substance should be prohibited in jokes and hoaxes such as sneezing powder;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas some plant-based sneezing powders present dangers to those who use them, especially children, and are already banned for this reason in some Member States;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas ammonium polysulphides have a corrosive effect and may cause serious, lasting damage, particularly to the eyes ; whereas these compounds, which are sold in particular to children as jokes or hoaxes are especially dangerous ; whereas their use should, consequently, be banned;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the volatile esters of bromaocetic acid are used as tear gas ; whereas they have an irritant effect upon and may be harmful to the respiratory system and the eyes ; whereas, in strong concentrations they produce a corrosive effect and can cause irreversible damage to the eyes ; whereas they should not be used by children and their use as a joke or hoax should, therefore, be prohibited;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the restrictions already introduced by some Member States in respect of the abovementioned substances directly affect the establishment or functioning of the common market ; whereas it is therefore necessary to harmonize existing legislation in this field in the Member States and to amend accordingly the Annex to Directive 76/769/EEC (5),</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">The following items shall be added to the Annex to Directive 76/769/EEC: &gt;PIC FILE= "T0023545"&gt; (1) OJ No C 288, 10.11.1981, p. 7. (2) OJ No C 125, 17.5.1982, p. 148. (3) OJ No C 112, 3.5.1982, p. 42. (4) OJ No L 197, 3.8.1979, p. 37. (5) OJ No L 262, 27.9.1976, p. 201.</p>
      <p n="17">&gt;PIC FILE= "T0023546"&gt;</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">Member States shall bring into force the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive within 18 months of notification (1). They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 3</p>
      <p n="21">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="22">Done at Brussels, 16 May 1983.</p>
      <p n="23">For the Council</p>
      <p n="24">The President</p>
      <p n="25">I. KIECHLE (1) This Directive was notified to the Member States on 19 May 1983.</p>
