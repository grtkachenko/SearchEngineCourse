      <p n="2">*****</p>
      <p n="3">COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 31/83</p>
      <p n="4">of 21 December 1982</p>
      <p n="5">on an interim common measure for restructuring the inshore fishing industry and aquaculture</p>
      <p n="6">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN</p>
      <p n="7">COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas Article 9 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 101/76 of 19 January 1976 laying down a common structural policy for the fishing industry (3) provides that common measures may be decided upon for the attainment of the objectives mentioned in paragraph 1 of that Article in so far as they relate to the objectives set out in Article 39 (1) (a) of the Treaty; whereas these common measures may be financed by the Guidance Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, hereinafter referred to as 'the Fund', under Article 1 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3509/80 (5);</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas action to restructure inshore fishing is necessary in order to promote the rational use of the available resources and the best use of production factors and to ensure an equitable standard of living for those who depend on fishing for their livelihood; whereas, for this purpose, the Commission proposed to the Council a common measure to restructure, modernize and develop the fishing industry and develop aquaculture (6); whereas this proposal has not yet been approved by the Council;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1852/78 of 25 July 1978 on an interim common measure for restructuring the inshore fishing industry (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2992/81 (8), has ensured the financing by the Fund, until 31 December 1981, of investment projects designed to develop inshore fishing or aquaculture; whereas this measure was intended, first and foremost, to help regions experiencing particular difficulties in developing production structures in the sectors in question;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas, pending a decision on the structural measures to be implemented as a whole as part of a common fisheries policy, such a measure should be continued under the year 1982;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas a contribution from the Fund in the form of a capital subsidy not exceeding 25 % of the total investment represents an appropriate participation in the realization thereof;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas some regions of the Community find themselves at a disadvantage from the point of view of income and under-employment both in the fishing industry and elsewhere; whereas structural development measures in these regions should be strengthened;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas time limits should be laid down for submission of aid applications to the Commission;</p>
      <p n="18">Whereas aid applications submitted for the first time under Regulation (EEC) No 1852/78 and not aided from the Fund for lack of available appropriations should be entertained under this Regulation;</p>
      <p n="19">Whereas, in order to ensure that beneficiaries observe the conditions laid down when aid is granted from the Fund, an effective control procedure should be provided for together with the possibility of suspending, reducing or discontinuing aid from the Fund,</p>
      <p n="20">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="21">TITLE I</p>

      <p n="24">1. The Fund may participate, under the year 1982 in the financing of investment projects for:</p>

      <p n="39">- they are consistent with a rational production policy and serve to improve the market supply situation,</p>
      <p n="40">- they permit a diversification of fishing activity, in particular through the use of several methods of fishing in keeping with the resources available in the fishing zones concerned,</p>
      <p n="41">- contribute to the adaptation of existing fishing capacity in relation to the requirements for the conservation of marine biological resources,</p>
      <p n="42">- they improve employment prospects in the inshore fishing industry or in aquaculture,</p>
      <p n="43">- they improve the working conditions and, in particular, the safety of the workers concerned.</p>

      <p n="48">- that the person operating the vessel in question has sufficient training to make the best use of the vessel's gear;</p>
      <p n="49">(b) for aquaculture:</p>
      <p n="50">- that the species to which the projects relate have already been bred commercially.</p>
      <p n="51">Article 6</p>
      <p n="52">1. Aid from the Fund shall consist of a capital subsidy paid in one or more instalments.</p>

      <p n="57">(a) the beneficiary shall finance at least 25 % of the total investment;</p>
