      <p n="2">PROTOCOL to the 1979 Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution on long-term financing of the cooperative programme for monitoring and evaluation of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe (EMEP)</p>
      <p n="3">THE CONTRACTING PARTIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Recalling that the Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution (hereinafter referred to as 'the Convention') entered into force on 16 March 1983,</p>
      <p n="5">Aware of the importance of the cooperative programme for the monitoring and evaluation of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe (hereinafter referred to as EMEP), as provided for in Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention,</p>
      <p n="6">Cognizant of the positive results achieved so far in the implementation of EMEP,</p>
      <p n="7">Recognizing that the implementation of EMEP has hitherto been made possible by financial means provided by the United Nations environment programme (UNEP) and by voluntary contributions from governments,</p>
      <p n="8">Bearing in mind that since the UNEP contribution will continue only until the end of 1984, and that since this contribution together with the voluntary contributions from governments have been inadequate to support fully the EMEP work plan, it will therefore be necessary to provide for long-term funding after 1984,</p>
      <p n="9">Considering the appeal of the Economic Commission for Europe to ECE member governments, contained in its decision B (XXXVIII), to make available, on a basis to be agreed at the first meeting of the Executive Body for the Convention (hereinafter referred to as the 'Executive Body'), the financial resources to enable the Executive Body to carry out its activities, in particular as regards the work of EMEP,</p>
      <p n="10">NÂ°ting that the Convention does not contain any provisions for financing EMEP and that it is, therefore, necessary to make appropriate arrangements regarding this matter,</p>
      <p n="11">Considering the elements to guide the drafting of a formal instrument supplementing the Convention, as listed in recommendations adopted by the Executive Body at its first session (7 to 10 June 1983),</p>
      <p n="12">HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">Definitions</p>
      <p n="15">For the purposes of the present Protocol:</p>
      <p n="16">1.'UN assessment rate' means a Contracting Party's rate for the financial year in question in the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations.</p>
      <p n="17">2.'Financial year' means the financial year of the United Nations; and 'annual basis' and 'annual costs' shall be construed accordingly.</p>
      <p n="18">3.'General Trust Fund' means the General Trust Fund for the financing of the implementation of the Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution, which has been established by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p>
      <p n="19">4.'Geographical scope of EMEP' means the area within which, coordinated by the international centres of EMEP(1), monitoring is carried out.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">Financing of EMEP</p>
      <p n="22">The financing of EMEP shall cover the annual costs of the international centres cooperating within EMEP for the activities appearing in the work programe of the Steering Body of EMEP.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
      <p n="24">Contributions</p>
      <p n="25">1. In accordance with the provisions of this Article the financing of EMEP shall consist of mandatory contributions, supplemented by voluntary contributions. Contributions may be made in convertible currency, non-convertible currency, or in kind.</p>

      <p n="28">4. The annual costs of the work programme shall be covered by the mandatory contributions. Contributions in cash and in kind, such as those provided by host countries for international centres, shall be specified in the work programme. Voluntary contributions may, subject to the approval by the executive Body, on the recommendation of the Steering Body, be utilized either for reducing the mandatory contributions or for financing specific activities within the scope of EMEP.</p>
      <p n="29">5. Mandatory and voluntary contributions in cash shall be deposited in the General Trust Fund.</p>
      <p n="30">Article 4</p>
