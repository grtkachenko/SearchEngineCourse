      <p n="3">COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1030/86</p>
      <p n="4">of 8 April 1986</p>
      <p n="5">on the classification of goods falling within subheading 73.40 B of the Common Customs Tariff</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 97/69 of 16 January 1969 on measures to be taken for uniform application of the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2055/84 (2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas, in order to ensure uniform application of the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff, provision must be made for the classification of a key-ring consisting of a small nickel-plated steel chain approximately 3 cm in length, with, at one end, a ring of the same metal that can be opened and closed and at the other a small protective cover of plastic material (approximately 5 × 2,5 cm) containing a miniature address book, the cover of which bears a promotional message;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the Common Customs Tariff annexed to Council Regulation (EEC) No 950/68 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3679/85 (4), lists within heading No 73.40 other articles of iron or steel and within heading No 48.18, amongst other things, registers, exercise books, note-books, memorandum blocks, order books, receipt books and diaries; whereas these headings may be taken into consideration in classifying the goods in question;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the key-ring is a composite article; whereas the address book is too small to be of practial use; whereas the ring and small chain, of nickel-plated steel, give the article, having regard to its normal use, its essential character within the meaning of General Rule 3 (b) for the interpretation of the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff; whereas the key-ring should therefore be classified within subheading 73.40 B;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Common Customs Tariff Nomenclature,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">A key-ring consisting of a small nickel-plated steel chain approximately 3 cm in length, with, at one end, a ring of the same metal that can be opened and closed and at the other a small protective cover of plastic material (approximately 5 × 2,5 cm) containing a miniature address book, the cover of which bears a promotional message, shall be classified in the Common Customs Tariff within subheading:</p>
      <p n="16">73.40 Other articles of iron or steel:</p>
      <p n="17">B. Other.</p>
      <p n="18">Article 2</p>
      <p n="19">This Regulation shall enter into force on the 21st day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Done at Brussels, 8 April 1986.</p>
