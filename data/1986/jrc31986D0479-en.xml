      <p n="4">of 18 September 1986</p>
      <p n="5">establishing an Advisory Committee on the protection of the environment in areas under serious threat (Mediterranean basin)</p>
      <p n="6">(86/479/EEC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas the action programme of the European Community on the environment (1982-86) adopted by the Council on 7 February 1983 (1) expressly states that the environment must be regarded as the basis constituting the limits to further economic and social development;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the Commission adopted on 11 April 1984 a communication defining a strategy and a plan of action for the protection of the environment in the Mediterranean (2), calling for the implementation of a range of coordinated measures which would create conditions conducive to the harmonious development of the region's socio-economic activities;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the abovementioned communication approving the proposal to establish an advisory committee (3);</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the Mediterranean basin is a region with particular physical, socio-economic and cultural characteristics whose problems and potential demand special attention in Community policies;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the Commission must consult experts from the Member States on pollution in areas where the environment is under particular threat;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas it is also necessary for the Community to have a forum in which the experts can meet to pool national information and experience, thus facilitating coordination of the measures taken or planned at national, international and Community level,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">An Advisory Committee on the protection of the environment in areas under serious threat, hereinafter referred to as 'the Committee', is hereby set up under the aegis of the Commission.</p>

      <p n="22">3. Direct its work towards the study and examination of questions whose solution will require the deployment of more substantial resources and in respect of which results may only be expected in the longer term;</p>
      <p n="23">4. Develop, with the help of the abovementioned resources, a medium- and long-term strategy and plan of action for the protection of the environment in the Mediterranean basin.</p>
      <p n="24">Article 3</p>

      <p n="32">office of a member or alternate shall end before expiry of the two-year period if the person in question dies or resigns, or the government which proposed him requests that he be replaced. His successor shall be appointed for the remainder of the term of office in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 4.</p>
      <p n="33">There shall be no remuneration for the tasks performed.</p>
      <p n="34">Article 7</p>

In such cases, only the members of the Committee and the representatives of the Commission's departments shall attend meetings of the Committee.</p>
