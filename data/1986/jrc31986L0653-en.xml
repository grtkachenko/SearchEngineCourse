      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 18 December 1986 on the coordination of the laws of the Member State relating to self-employed commercial agents (86/653/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 57(2) and 100 thereof,</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),</p>
      <p n="6">(1) OJ No C 13, 18.1.1977, p.2; OJ No C 56, 2.3.1979, p.5.</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),</p>
      <p n="8">(2) OJ No C 239, 9.10.1978, p.17.</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),</p>
      <p n="10">(3) OJ No C 59, 8.03.1978, p.31.</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas the restrictions on the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services in respect of activities of intermediaries in commerce, industry and small craft industries were abolished by Directive 64/224/EEC (4);</p>
      <p n="12">(4) OJ No 56, 4.4.1964, p.869/64.</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas the differences in national laws concerning commercial representation substantially affect the conditions of competition and the carrying-on of that activity within the Community and are detrimental both to the protection available to commercial agents vis-Ã -vis their principals and to the security of commercial transactions; whereas moreover those differences are such as to inhibit substantially the conclusion and operation of commerical representation contracts where principal and commercial agents are established in different Member States;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas trade in goods between Member States should be carried on under conditions which are similar to those of a single market, and this necessitates approximation of the legal systems of the Member States to the extent required for the proper functioning of the common market; whereas in this regard the rules concerning conflict of laws do not, in the matter of commercial representation, remove the inconsistencies referred to above, nor would they even if they were made uniform, and accordingly the proposed harmonization is necessary notwithstanding the existence of those rules;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas in this regard the legal relationship between commercial agent and principal must be given priority;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas it is appropriate to be guided by the principles of Article 117 of the Treaty and to maintain improvementsalready made, when harmonizing the laws of the Member States relating to commercial agents;</p>
      <p n="17">Whereas additional transitional periods should be allowed for certain Member States which have to make a particular effort to adapt their regulations, especially those concerning indemnity for termination of contract between the principal and the commercial agent, to the requirements of this Directive,</p>
      <p n="18">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>

      <p n="113">(b) The amount of the indemnity may not exceed a figure equivalent to an indemnity for one year calculated from the commercial agent's average annual remuneration over the preceding five years and if the contract goes back less than five years the indemnity shall be calculated on the average for the period in question;</p>
      <p n="114">(c) The grant of such an indemnity shall not prevent the commercial agent from seeking damages.</p>
      <p n="115">3. The commercial agent shall be entitled to compensation for the damage he suffers as a result of the termination of his relations with the principal.</p>
      <p n="116">Such damage shall be deemed to occur particularly when the termination takes place in circumstances:</p>

      <p n="122">Article 18</p>
      <p n="123">The indemnity or compensation referred to in Article 17 shall not be payable:</p>
      <p n="124">(a) where the principal has terminated the agency contract because of default attributable to the commercial agent which would justify immediate termination of the agency contract under national law;</p>
      <p n="125">(b) where the commercial agent has terminated the agency contract, unless such termination is justified by circumstances attributable to the principal or on grounds of age, infirmity or illness of the commercial agent in consequence of which he cannot reasonably be required to continue his activities;</p>
      <p n="126">(c) where, with the agreement of the principal, the commercial agent assigns his rights and duties under the agency contract to another person.</p>
      <p n="127">Article 19</p>

      <p n="129">Article 20</p>
      <p n="130">1. For the purposes of this Directive an agreement restricting the business activities of a commercial agent following termination of the agency contract is hereinafter referred to as a restraint of trade clause.</p>
      <p n="131">2. A restraint of trade clause shall be valid only if and to the extent that:</p>
      <p n="132">(a) it is concluded in writing; and</p>
      <p n="133">(b) it relates to the geographical area or the group of customers and the geographical area entrusted to the commercial agent and to the kind of goods covered by his agency under the contract.</p>
      <p n="134">3. A restraint of trade clause shall be valid for not more than two years after termination of the agency contract.</p>
      <p n="135">4. This Article shall not affect provisions of national law which impose other restrictions on the validity or enforceability of restraint of trade clauses or which enable the courts to reduce the obligations on the parties resulting from such an agreement.</p>
      <p n="136">CHAPTER V</p>
      <p n="137">General and final provisions</p>
      <p n="138">Article 21</p>
