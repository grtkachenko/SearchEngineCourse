      <p n="9">Whereas the work on the dissemination of agricultural information provided for in Article 41 of the Treaty can be coordinated more effectively by cooperation between the Commission and the national experts concerned within a committee of experts;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas, for this purpose, an Advisory Committee on the Dissemination of Agricultural Information should be set up, on which are represented the Member States' agricultural information departments,</p>
      <p n="11">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="12">Article 1</p>

      <p n="14">Article 2</p>
      <p n="15">1. The Committee shall be composed of the heads of the agricultural advisory services of the Member States, each being assisted by a specialist in the area of information transfer.</p>
      <p n="16">2. The head of an advisory service may, from time to time and at his own discretion, be replaced at any particular meeting by a member of his service who is the advisory specialist in the subject matter under discussion at that meeting.</p>

      <p n="20">The Committee may be consulted by the Commission on the most effective ways and means of:</p>
      <p n="21">(a) improving the practical effectiveness of the Community-wide inventory of agricultural research (AGREP) and the FAO/EEC Agricultural data base (EUR-AGRIS);</p>
      <p n="22">(b) providing the Commission, in liaison with the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research, with all pertinent information on agricultural and farm problems whose solution is vital to the continuing development of the common agricultural policy;</p>

      <p n="24">(d) improving, as necessary, the content, methods of implementation and effectiveness of structural policy measures in any given area or region of the Community;</p>
      <p n="25">(e) communicating all relevant information on other pertinent aspects of the common agricultural policy to persons working in agriculture throughout the Community.</p>

It may also be terminated where the advisory service which the member represents requests that he be replaced. In either case, a person shall be appointed by the advisory service concerned, following appropriate consultation with the Commission, to replace such member for the remainder of the term of office in question.</p>
      <p n="30">4. Members shall not be remunerated for their services.</p>
      <p n="31">5. A list of members of the Committee shall be published by the Commission for information purposes in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>

      <p n="35">1. No vote shall be taken on the matters discussed by the Committee.</p>
      <p n="36">2. The Commission may, when seeking the opinion of the Committee, set a time limit within which such opinion shall be given. 3. The views expressed by the various advisory services represented shall be included in a summary record forwarded to the Commission.</p>

      <p n="42">This Decision shall take effect on 12 May 1986.</p>
