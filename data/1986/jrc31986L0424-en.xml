      <p n="45">Sample containers and closures shall be of materials and construction which adequately protect the sample and which do not bring about in the sample a change which may affect any result of the subsequent analysis or examination. Materials which are appropriate include glass, some metals and some plastics. The containers shall preferably be opaque. If transparent or translucent the containers with contents shall be stored in a dark place.</p>

      <p n="47">Single service plastic containers, containers made from plastic, laminates including an aluminium foil or suitable plastic bags, with appropriate methods of closure, may be used.</p>
      <p n="48">Containers other than plastic bags shall be securely closed either by means of a suitable stopper or by a screw-cap of metal or plastic material having, if necessary, an air-tight plastic liner. Any stopper or liner used should be insoluble, non-absorbant and greaseproof, and will not influence the odour, flavour, properties or composition of the sample.</p>

      <p n="58">This method describes the sampling for chemical analysis of:</p>
      <p n="59">- edible acid caseins,</p>
      <p n="60">- edible rennet caseins,</p>
      <p n="61">- edible caseinates.</p>
      <p n="62">2. Equipment</p>
      <p n="63">See Section 2 of General Provisions.</p>
      <p n="64">2.1. Borers</p>
      <p n="65">Of sufficient length to reach the bottom of the product container. Borers conforming to the description given in Part III of this Directive are appropriate.</p>
      <p n="66">2.2. Spoon, spatula or scoop</p>
      <p n="67">Broad-loaded.</p>
      <p n="68">2.3. Sample containers</p>
      <p n="69">See Section 3 of General Provisions.</p>
      <p n="70">3. Procedure</p>
      <p n="71">3.1. General</p>
      <p n="72">Care shall be taken to minimize the uptake of atmospheric moisture by the content of the product container during or in the period prior to sampling for analysis. The product container shall be securely reclosed after sampling.</p>
      <p n="73">3.2. Procedure</p>
      <p n="74">3.2.1. Sampling</p>
      <p n="75">A sample of not less than 200 grams shall be taken. The clean and dry borer shall be passed through the product, if necessary with the container inclined or laid on its side. The slit shall be oriented downward and an even rate of penetration used. When the borer reaches the bottom of the container it shall be rotated through 180°, withdrawn and the contents discharged into the sample container. One or more bores shall be taken to make a sample of not less than 200 grams. The sample container shall be closed immediately after sampling is complete. Such sampling shall be carried out on the same batch.</p>
      <p n="76">3.2.2. Sampling products packed in small retail packages</p>
      <p n="77">The intact and unopened package may constitute the sample. As far as possible one or more packages of the same batch should be taken to form a sample of not less than 200 grams.</p>
      <p n="78">If this is not possible, use another method to constitute a representative sample.</p>
      <p n="79">3.2.3. Preservation, storage and transport of sample</p>
      <p n="80">Sections 5 and 6 of the General Provisions.</p>
      <p n="81">III. BORERS FOR THE SAMPLING OF EDIBLE CASEINS AND CASEINATES IN BULK</p>
      <p n="82">1. Types of borer</p>
      <p n="83">Type A: Long (see fig. 1);</p>
      <p n="84">Type B: Short (see fig. 1).</p>
      <p n="85">2. Materials</p>
      <p n="86">Blade and stem shall be made of polished metal, preferably stainless steel. The grip of the long type should preferably be made of stainless steel. The short type borer shall have a detachable grip of wood or plastic, fitted with a bayonet-catch in the blade.</p>
      <p n="87">3. Construction</p>
      <p n="88">3.1. Shape, material and finish shall be such as to permit the borer to be easily cleaned.</p>
      <p n="89">3.2. The protruding edge of the blade of type A shall be sufficiently sharp to serve as a scraper.</p>
      <p n="90">3.3. The point of the blade shall be sufficiently sharp as to facilitate sampling. 4. Principal dimensions</p>
      <p n="91">The borers shall conform to the dimensions (subject to a tolerance of 10 %) given in the table below:</p>
      <p n="92">(in mm)</p>
      <p n="93">1.2.3 // // // // // Type A Long // Type B Short // // // // Length of blade // 800 // 400 // Thickness of metal of blade // 1 to 2 // 1 to 2 // Inner diameter of blade at point // 18 // 32 // Inner diameter of blade at grip or stem // 22 // 28 // Slit width at point // 4 // 20 // Slit width at grip or stem // 14 // 14 // // //</p>
      <p n="94">5. Note on use of borers</p>
      <p n="95">5.1. With less free-flowing powders, the borers can be inserted vertically. Type A borers are filled completely by turning and then can be withdrawn vertically.</p>
      <p n="96">Type B borers are already filled completely during insertion but must be withdrawn in an oblique position to prevent losses from the lower end.</p>
      <p n="97">5.2. In the case of free-flowing powder, the containers shall be inclined, the borers inserted nearly horizontally with the slit downwards and withdrawn with the slit upwards.</p>
