      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine animals and swine and fresh meat from third countries (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3768/85 (2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 77/96/EEC of 21 December 1976 on the examination for trichinae (trichinella spiralis) upon importation from third countries of fresh meat derived from domestic swine (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3768/85, and in particular Article 6 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas by Decision 83/196/EEC of 8 April 1983 concerning the on-the-spot inspections to be carried out in respect of the importation of bovine animals, swine and fresh meat from non-member countries (4), the Commission provisionally laid down the conditions for Community inspections; whereas, in the light of the satisfactory experience gained during on-the-spot inspections, it is advisable to fix the methods of control definitively;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">1. Under the direction of the Commission, veterinary experts from the Member States and the Commission shall carry out veterinary inspections on-the-spot, to verify whether the provisions of Directive 72/462/EEC, and in particular Article 3 (2) thereof, are being applied in practice. These inspections shall be carried out every three years in every country appearing on the list drawn up in accordance with Article 3 (1) of the said Directive.</p>
      <p n="16">If, however, reasons of animal health so warrant, the Commission may, following consultation with the Member States within the Standing Veterinary Committee, postpone or advance certain inspections or carry out additional inspections.</p>
      <p n="17">2. Veterinary experts from the Member States and the Commission shall carry out, under the direction of the Commission, a veterinary inspection in the country or countries concerned before a proposal for a Decision to supplement the list drawn up in accordance with Article 3 (1) of Directive 72/462/EEC is submitted to the Standing Veterinary Committee.</p>
      <p n="18">3. At the particular request of a Member State, veterinary experts from the Member States and the Commission may carry out, under the direction of the Commission, a veterinary inspection in the country or countries concerned before submitting to the Standing Veterinary Committee a proposal for a Decision:</p>

      <p n="23">1. Under the direction of the Commission, veterinary experts from the Member States and the Commission shall carry out health inspections on-the-spot to verify whether the provisions of Directive 72/462/EEC, and in particular Article 4 (2) and (3) thereof, and of Directive 77/96/EEC are being applied in practice.

      <p n="27">- replace these systematic inspections by sample inspections.</p>
      <p n="28">2.

      <p n="29">3. At the particular request of a Member State, veterinary experts from the Member States and the Commission may, under the direction of the Commission, subject the establishment or establishments concerned to an on-the-spot health inspection before submitting to the Standing Veterinary Committee a proposal for a Decision:</p>
