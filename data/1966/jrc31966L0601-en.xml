      <p n="2">COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 25 October 1966 amending the Council Directive of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat (66/601/EEC)</p>
      <p n="3">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY,</p>
      <p n="4">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100 thereof;</p>
      <p n="5">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament 1;</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee;</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas the Council Directive of 26 June 1964 2 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat entered into force on 30 June 1965;</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas that Directive constitutes the first stage of a harmonisation designed to eliminate obstacles to trade arising from differences between the veterinary provisions of Member States, in particular as regards meat hygiene;</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas the incorporation of that Directive in the laws of each Member State has shown that its provisions should be adapted in the light of new technical and scientific data and the experience gained;</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas, therefore, certain amendments must be made to the original text as soon as possible, but without detriment to the basic standards and principles of the system instituted by that Directive;</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas, in the light of the experience gained, some of the definitions contained in that Directive should be amplified;</p>
      <p n="13">Whereas it must be specified that the reasons for prohibiting the marketing of meat must be stated at the time of the health inspection carried out in the country of destination, in particular to enable the powers of the veterinary expert responsible for delivering an opinion for the consignor to be defined;</p>
      <p n="14">Whereas it should be expressly stated that in trade in fresh meat not intended for human consumption, national provisions shall remain in force until such time as Community regulations are adopted;</p>
      <p n="15">Whereas the provisions on slaughterhouse hygiene must be maintained but the requirement that in slaughterhouses special places be provided where certain specific species of animal are not slaughtered can be withdrawn;</p>
      <p n="16">Whereas experience has shown that stamping requirements should be amended as regards small cuts of meat and offal and that the use of violet colouring matters in addition to methyl violet should be authorised for stamping meat;</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
