      <p n="2">Commission Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 29 November 2002</p>
      <p n="4">establishing revised ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to detergents for dishwashers and amending Decision 1999/427/EC</p>
      <p n="5">(notified under document number C(2002) 4632)</p>
      <p n="6">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="7">(2003/31/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 the Community eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria are to be established according to product groups.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) It also provides that the review of the eco-label criteria, as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to the criteria, is to take place in due time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for each product group.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) It is appropriate to revise the ecological criteria that were established by Commission Decision 1999/427/EC of 28 May 1999 establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to detergents for dishwashers(2), in order to reflect the developments in the market. At the same time, the period of validity of that Decision as extended by Decision 2002/173/EC(3) and the definition of the product group should be modified.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) A new Decision should be adopted establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of five years.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than 18 months, both the new criteria and the criteria established by Decision 1999/427/EC should be valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies that have been awarded or that have applied for the award of the eco-label for their products prior to the date of application of this Decision, to adapt those products to comply with the new criteria.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are based on the draft criteria developed by the European Union Eco-Labelling Board established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,</p>
      <p n="20">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="21">Article 1</p>
      <p n="22">In order to be awarded the Community eco-label under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, a detergent for dishwashers must fall within the product group "detergents for dishwashers" as defined in Article 2, and must comply with the ecological criteria set out in the Annex to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 2</p>
      <p n="24">The product group "detergents for dishwashers" shall comprise all detergents intended for use exclusively in automatic domestic dishwashers and all detergents intended for use in automatic dishwashers operated by professional users but similar to automatic domestic dishwashers in terms of machine size and usage.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 3</p>
      <p n="26">For administrative purposes the code number assigned to the product group "detergents for dishwashers" shall be "015".</p>
      <p n="27">Article 4</p>
      <p n="28">Article 3 of Decision 1999/427/EC is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="29">"Article 3</p>
      <p n="30">The product group definition and the specific ecological criteria for the product group shall be valid until 31 May 2004."</p>
      <p n="31">Article 5</p>
      <p n="32">This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2003 until 31 December 2007.</p>
      <p n="33">Producers of products falling within the product group "detergents for dishwashers" which have already been awarded the eco-label before 1 January 2003 may continue to use that label until 31 May 2004.</p>
      <p n="34">Producers of products falling within the product group "detergents for dishwashers" which have already applied for the award of the eco-label before 1 January 2003 may be awarded the eco-label under the terms of Decision 1999/427/EC. In these cases the label may be used until 31 May 2004.</p>
      <p n="35">Article 6</p>
      <p n="36">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="37">Done at Brussels, 29 November 2002.</p>

      <p n="44">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="45">FRAMEWORK</p>
      <p n="46">The aims of the criteria</p>
      <p n="47">These criteria aim in particular at promoting:</p>
      <p n="48">- reduction of water pollution both by reducing the quantity of detergent used and by limiting the quantity of harmful ingredients,</p>
      <p n="49">- reduction of energy use by promoting low temperature detergents,</p>
      <p n="50">- the minimisation of waste by reducing the amount of primary packaging.</p>
      <p n="51">Additionally, the criteria enhance the consumers' environmental awareness. The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of detergents for dishwashers that have a low environmental impact.</p>
      <p n="52">Assessment and verification requirements</p>
      <p n="53">The specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion.</p>
      <p n="54">Where the applicant is required to provide declarations, documentation, analyses, test reports, or other evidence to show compliance with the criteria, it is understood that these may originate from the applicant and/or his supplier(s) and/or their supplier(s), et cetera, as appropriate.</p>
      <p n="55">Where possible, the testing should be performed by laboratories that meet the general requirements of EN ISO 17025 or equivalent.</p>
      <p n="56">Where appropriate, test methods other than those indicated for each criterion may be used if the competent body assessing the application accepts their equivalence.</p>
      <p n="57">Where appropriate, competent bodies may require supporting documentation and may carry out independent verifications.</p>
      <p n="58">Where appropriate, the applicant may use subsequent revisions of the Detergent Ingredient Database as they become available.</p>
      <p n="59">The competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria (note: it is not required to implement such management schemes.).</p>
      <p n="60">Functional unit and reference dosage</p>
      <p n="61">The functional unit, to which inputs and outputs should be related, shall be the quantity of product required to wash 12 place settings with a standard soil (as defined by DIN or ISO standards). The dosage recommended by the manufacturer to consumers for normally soiled dishes and 12 place settings is taken as a reference dosage under standard conditions, as laid down in the IKW washing performance test referred to in criterion 6.</p>
      <p n="62">CRITERIA</p>
      <p n="63">1. Environmental scoring matrix</p>
      <p n="64">The following five parameters are included in an environmental matrix and are aggregated and assessed as a whole, as presented below:</p>
      <p n="65">- total chemicals,</p>
      <p n="66">- critical dilution volume, toxicity (CDVtox),</p>
      <p n="67">- phosphates (expressed as sodium tripolyphosphate - STPP),</p>
      <p n="68">- aerobic non-biodegradable organics (aNBDO),</p>
      <p n="69">- anaerobic non-biodegradable organics (anNBDO).</p>
      <p n="70">The following table summarises these parameters and their related scoring, their exclusion hurdles and their weighting factors. The formulae for calculating the score for each parameter and the exclusion hurdles are detailed below in points (a) to (f). The parameters are calculated for each ingredient by considering the dosage per wash, water content and mass percentage in the formulation and they are added up for each product formulation.</p>
      <p n="71">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="72">Note:</p>

      <p n="77">&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p>
      <p n="78">where weight (i) is the weight of the ingredient per recommended dose, LF is the loading factor and LTE is the long-term toxicity effect concentration of the ingredient. The CDVtox is summed for each ingredient (i), making the CDVtox for the product:</p>
      <p n="79">CDVtox = [sum ] CDVtox (ingredient i)</p>
      <p n="80">CDVtox shall be &lt;= 200 l/wash.</p>
      <p n="81">Score (CDVtox) = (5 - (CDVtox/60)) x 8</p>
      <p n="82">Assessment and verification: The exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the Competent Body, together with the details of the CDVtox calculations and the related score. For all ingredients included in the Detergent Ingredient Database (DID-list, see Annex IA), the relevant values given in the DID-list shall be used, and the corresponding ingredient number shall be given. In the case of new chemicals or additional ingredients that are not listed in the DID list the approach described in Appendix I.B shall be followed.</p>

      <p n="88">(c) Phosphates (as STPP - sodium tripolyphosphate)</p>
      <p n="89">Phosphates are the quantity of phosphates in the formulation calculated as STPP.</p>
      <p n="90">Phosphates shall be &lt;= 10 g/wash.</p>
      <p n="91">Score (Phosphates) = (4 - (Phosphates/2,5)) x 2</p>
      <p n="92">Assessment and verification: The exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the Competent Body, together with the details of phosphate calculations and the related score.</p>

      <p n="186">A. The data given below on the most commonly used detergent ingredients shall be used for the calculation of the ecological criteria</p>
      <p n="187">Note:</p>

      <p n="192">Y= yes, criterion applies</p>
      <p n="193">O= no, criterion does not apply</p>
      <p n="194">LTE= long term effect concentration</p>
      <p n="195">NOEC= non observed effect concentration</p>
      <p n="196">CF= correction factor for anaerobic non degradable organic substances</p>
      <p n="197">THOD= theoretical oxygen demand</p>
      <p n="198">Appendix I.B</p>
      <p n="199">The following approach applies, as appropriate in the case of ingredients that are not listed on the DID-list</p>
      <p n="200">Aquatic toxicity</p>
      <p n="201">The lowest validated long-term effect (LTE) data on fish, daphnia magna or algae should be considered for the calculation of the critical dilution volume criterion (toxicity).</p>
      <p n="202">In cases where data on homologues and/or QSARs (quantitative structure activity relationships) are used, a correction could be considered for the finally selected LTE data.</p>
      <p n="203">In the absence of LTE data the following procedure has to be applied in order to estimate the LTE data by using the specified uncertainty factor (UF) on the data of the most sensitive species:</p>
      <p n="204">Non surfactants</p>
      <p n="205">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="206">Deviation from this rule may be admitted if evidence can be provided that lower factors or data can be scientifically justified. NOEC is the No Observed Effect Concentration (in a chronic test).</p>
      <p n="207">Surfactants</p>
      <p n="208">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="209">In the last case referred to above, an uncertainty factor of 20 may be used instead of 50 only if 1-2 L(E)C50 (LC 50 in case of fish toxicity, EC50 in case of daphnia or algal toxicity) data are available and if it can be concluded from the information for other compounds that the most sensitive species have been tested. Such a rule can be applied only within a group of homologues. It should be emphasised that the LTEs (long-term effects) used must be consistent within a group of homologues with respect to the influence of e.g. length of alkyl chain for LAS (linear alkylbenzene sulphonate) or number of EOs (ethoxy groups) for alcohol-ethoxylate if such QSARs can be established.</p>
      <p n="210">Any deviation from the above-described scheme has to be well reasoned for the specific chemical.</p>
      <p n="211">Loading factors</p>
      <p n="212">Loading factors shall be established according to Commission Directive 93/67/EEC of 20 July 1993 laying down the principles for assessment of risk to man and the environment of substances(1) notified in accordance with Council Directive 67/548/EEC and to Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93(2).</p>

      <p n="215">(1) OJ L 227, 8.9.1993, p. 9.</p>
      <p n="216">(2) OJ L 84, 5.4.1993, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="217">(3) The correction factors are to be established on the basis of the ingredient properties and applied to the dosage expressed in g/wash.</p>
      <p n="218">Appendix I.C</p>
      <p n="219">Documentation of anaerobic biodegradability</p>
      <p n="220">The following approach may be used to provide the necessary documentation of anaerobic degradability in the case of ingredients that are not listed in the DID-list:</p>
      <p n="221">1. Apply reasonable extrapolation</p>
      <p n="222">Use test results obtained with one raw material to extrapolate the ultimate anaerobic degradability of structurally related surfactants. If anaerobic biodegradability has been confirmed for a surfactant (or a group of homologues) according to the DID-list, it can be assumed that a similar type of surfactant is also anaerobically biodegradable (e.g., C12-15 A 1-3 EO sulphate (DID No 8) is anaerobically biodegradable, and a similar anaerobic biodegradability may also be assumed for C12-15 A 6 EO sulphate). If anaerobic biodegradability has been confirmed for a surfactant by use of an appropriate test method, it can be assumed that a similar type of surfactant is also anaerobically biodegradable (e.g., literature data confirming the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactants belonging to the group alkyl ester ammonium salts may be used as documentation for a similar anaerobic biodegradability of other quaternary ammonium salts containing ester-linkages in the alkyl chain(s)).</p>
      <p n="223">2. Perform screening test for anaerobic degradability</p>
      <p n="224">If new testing is necessary, perform a screening test by use of ISO 11734, ECETOC No 28 (June 1988) or an equivalent method.</p>
      <p n="225">3. Perform low-dosage degradability test</p>
      <p n="226">If new testing is necessary, and in the case of experimental problems in the screening test (e.g. inhibition due to toxicity of test substance), repeat testing by using a low dosage of surfactant and monitor degradation by 14C measurements or chemical analyses. Testing at low dosages may be performed by use of OECD 308 (August 2000) or an equivalent method.</p>
