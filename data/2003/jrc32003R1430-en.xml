      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1430/2003 of 11 August 2003 revising the maximum amount for the B production levy and amending the minimum price for B beet in the sugar sector for the 2003/04 marketing year</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1430/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 11 August 2003</p>
      <p n="4">revising the maximum amount for the B production levy and amending the minimum price for B beet in the sugar sector for the 2003/04 marketing year</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second and third indents of Article 15(8) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Article 15(3) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provide that the losses resulting from the obligation to export surpluses of Community sugar are to be covered, within certain limits, by production levies on the production of A and B sugar, of A and B isoglucose and of inulin syrup A and B.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that, where the receipts expected from the basic production levy and the B levy, which must not exceed 2 % and 30 %, respectively, of the intervention price for white sugar for that marketing year, may well fail to cover the foreseeable total loss for the current marketing year, the maximum percentage of the B levy is to be adjusted to the extent necessary to cover the said total loss but without exceeding 37,5 %.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) According to the provisional data currently available, the receipts, before adjustment, of the levies to be collected in respect of the 2003/04 marketing year are likely to be below the equivalent of the average loss multiplied by the exportable surplus. The maximum amount of the B levy for 2003/04 should therefore be raised to 37,5 % of the intervention price for the white sugar concerned.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 fixes the minimum price for B beet at EUR 32,42 per tonne, subject to Article 15(5) of that Regulation, which provides for the corresponding adjustment of the price for B beet in the event of adjustment of the maximum amount of the B levy.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">For the 2003/04 marketing year, the maximum amount of the B levy referred to in the first indent of Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 shall be increased to 37,5 % of the intervention price for white sugar.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">For the 2003/04 marketing year, the minimum price for B beet referred to in Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 shall be fixed, in accordance with Article 15(5) of that Regulation, at EUR 28,84 per tonne.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 3</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="22">Done at Brussels, 11 August 2003.</p>
      <p n="23">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="24">Franz Fischler</p>
      <p n="25">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="26">(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="27">(2) OJ L 104, 20.4.2002, p. 26.</p>
