      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 876/2003 of 21 May 2003 defining specific measures pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 concerning catches and landings of deep-sea species for seasonal fisheries by Denmark in the Skagerrak and North Sea</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 876/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 21 May 2003</p>
      <p n="4">defining specific measures pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 concerning catches and landings of deep-sea species for seasonal fisheries by Denmark in the Skagerrak and North Sea</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 of 16 December 2002 establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks(1), and in particular Article 3(3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 prohibits the retention on board, transhipment or landing of any aggregate quantity of deep-sea species in excess of 100 kilograms in each sea trip unless the vessel in question holds a deep-sea fishing permit.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 provides however, that upon request of a Member State, specific measures may be laid down by the Commission to take account of seasonal or artisanal fisheries.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Denmark has asked for specific measures to be laid down to take account of the seasonal nature of fisheries for deep-sea species in the Skagerrak and in Norwegian waters of ICES Division IVa.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Denmark has made available detailed catch information for the fisheries concerned demonstrating the evident need for such measures in order to avoid discarding, in that unavoidable by-catches up to 300 kilograms of some deep-sea species are routinely taken in fisheries targeting other species, such as witch, during some months of the year.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) It is therefore appropriate to allow Danish vessels not holding a deep-sea fishing permit to retain on board, tranship or land defined quantities of deep-sea species in order to reduce discarding and to reduce waste from the fisheries concerned.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="16">Article 1</p>
      <p n="17">Scope</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation applies to fishing vessels flying the flag of Denmark and registered in the Community which are engaged in the following activities:</p>
      <p n="19">(a) fishing within Norwegian waters of ICES Division IVa in the period 1 May to 31 October and returning directly to port in the period 1 May to 10 November after having fished in Norwegian waters of ICES Division IVa in the period 1 May to 31 October;</p>
      <p n="20">(b) fishing within the Skagerrak in the period 1 April to 31 May and returning directly to port in the period 1 April to 5 June after having fished in the Skagerrak in the period 1 April to 31 May.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>
      <p n="22">Specific measures</p>
      <p n="23">By way of derogation from Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002:</p>
      <p n="24">1. vessels which are engaged in the activity defined in Article 1(a) and which do not hold a deep-sea fishing permit shall be authorised to retain on board, tranship or to land:</p>
      <p n="25">(a) any quantity of blue ling (Molva dypterigia) less than 300 kilograms;</p>
      <p n="26">(b) any aggregate quantity of deep-sea species other than blue ling (Molva dypterigia) less than 100 kilograms;</p>
      <p n="27">2. vessels which are engaged in the activity described in Article 1(b) and which do not hold a deep-sea fishing permit shall be authorised to retain on board, tranship or to land:</p>
      <p n="28">(a) any quantity of roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) less than 300 kilograms;</p>
      <p n="29">(b) any aggregate quantity of deep-sea species other than roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) less than 100 kilograms;</p>
      <p n="30">3. vessels which are engaged in both the activities defined in Article 1(a) and Article 1(b) which do not hold a deep-sea fishing permit shall be authorised to retain on board, tranship or to land:</p>
      <p n="31">(a) any quantity of roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) less than 300 kilograms;</p>
      <p n="32">(b) any quantity of blue ling (Molva dypterigia) less than 300 kilograms;</p>
      <p n="33">(c) any aggregate quantity of deep-sea species other than roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and blue ling (Molva dypterigia) less than 100 kilograms.</p>
      <p n="34">Article 3</p>
      <p n="35">This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="36">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="37">Done at Brussels, 21 May 2003.</p>
      <p n="38">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="39">Franz Fischler</p>
