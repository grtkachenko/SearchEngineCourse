      <p n="2">Directive 2003/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 26 May 2003</p>
      <p n="4">providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending with regard to public participation and access to justice Council Directives 85/337/EEC and 96/61/EC</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 15 January 2003,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Community legislation in the field of the environment aims to contribute to preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment and protecting human health.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Community environmental legislation includes provisions for public authorities and other bodies to take decisions which may have a significant effect on the environment as well as on personal health and well-being.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Effective public participation in the taking of decisions enables the public to express, and the decision-maker to take account of, opinions and concerns which may be relevant to those decisions, thereby increasing the accountability and transparency of the decision-making process and contributing to public awareness of environmental issues and support for the decisions taken.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) Participation, including participation by associations, organisations and groups, in particular non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection, should accordingly be fostered, including inter alia by promoting environmental education of the public.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) On 25 June 1998 the Community signed the UN/ECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Århus Convention). Community law should be properly aligned with that Convention with a view to its ratification by the Community.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) Among the objectives of the Århus Convention is the desire to guarantee rights of public participation in decision-making in environmental matters in order to contribute to the protection of the right to live in an environment which is adequate for personal health and well-being.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) Article 6 of the Århus Convention provides for public participation in decisions on the specific activities listed in Annex I thereto and on activities not so listed which may have a significant effect on the environment.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) Article 7 of the Århus Convention provides for public participation concerning plans and programmes relating to the environment.</p>
      <p n="20">(9) Article 9(2) and (4) of the Århus Convention provides for access to judicial or other procedures for challenging the substantive or procedural legality of decisions, acts or omissions subject to the public participation provisions of Article 6 of the Convention.</p>
      <p n="21">(10) Provision should be made in respect of certain Directives in the environmental area which require Member States to produce plans and programmes relating to the environment but which do not contain sufficient provisions on public participation, so as to ensure public participation consistent with the provisions of the Århus Convention, in particular Article 7 thereof. Other relevant Community legislation already provides for public participation in the preparation of plans and programmes and, for the future, public participation requirements in line with the Århus Convention will be incorporated into the relevant legislation from the outset.</p>
      <p n="22">(11) Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment(5), and Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control(6) should be amended to ensure that they are fully compatible with the provisions of the Århus Convention, in particular Article 6 and Article 9(2) and (4) thereof.</p>
      <p n="23">(12) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely to contribute to the implementation of the obligations arising under the Århus Convention, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,</p>
      <p n="24">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="25">Article 1</p>
      <p n="26">Objective</p>
      <p n="27">The objective of this Directive is to contribute to the implementation of the obligations arising under the Århus Convention, in particular by:</p>
      <p n="28">(a) providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment;</p>
      <p n="29">(b) improving the public participation and providing for provisions on access to justice within Council Directives 85/337/EEC and 96/61/EC.</p>
      <p n="30">Article 2</p>
      <p n="31">Public participation concerning plans and programmes</p>
      <p n="32">1. For the purposes of this Article, "the public" shall mean one or more natural or legal persons and, in accordance with national legislation or practice, their associations, organisations or groups.</p>
      <p n="33">2. Member States shall ensure that the public is given early and effective opportunities to participate in the preparation and modification or review of the plans or programmes required to be drawn up under the provisions listed in Annex I.</p>
      <p n="34">To that end, Member States shall ensure that:</p>
      <p n="35">(a) the public is informed, whether by public notices or other appropriate means such as electronic media where available, about any proposals for such plans or programmes or for their modification or review and that relevant information about such proposals is made available to the public including inter alia information about the right to participate in decision-making and about the competent authority to which comments or questions may be submitted;</p>
      <p n="36">(b) the public is entitled to express comments and opinions when all options are open before decisions on the plans and programmes are made;</p>
      <p n="37">(c) in making those decisions, due account shall be taken of the results of the public participation;</p>
      <p n="38">(d) having examined the comments and opinions expressed by the public, the competent authority makes reasonable efforts to inform the public about the decisions taken and the reasons and considerations upon which those decisions are based, including information about the public participation process.</p>
      <p n="39">3. Member States shall identify the public entitled to participate for the purposes of paragraph 2, including relevant non-governmental organisations meeting any requirements imposed under national law, such as those promoting environmental protection.</p>
      <p n="40">The detailed arrangements for public participation under this Article shall be determined by the Member States so as to enable the public to prepare and participate effectively.</p>
      <p n="41">Reasonable time-frames shall be provided allowing sufficient time for each of the different stages of public participation required by this Article.</p>
      <p n="42">4. This Article shall not apply to plans and programmes designed for the sole purpose of serving national defence or taken in case of civil emergencies.</p>
      <p n="43">5. This Article shall not apply to plans and programmes set out in Annex I for which a public participation procedure is carried out under Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment(7) or under Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy(8).</p>
      <p n="44">Article 3</p>
      <p n="45">Amendment of Directive 85/337/EEC</p>

      <p n="52">3. in Article 2(3), points (a) and (b) shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="53">"(a) consider whether another form of assessment would be appropriate;</p>
      <p n="54">(b) make available to the public concerned the information obtained under other forms of assessment referred to in point (a), the information relating to the exemption decision and the reasons for granting it.";</p>

      <p n="68">4. The public concerned shall be given early and effective opportunities to participate in the environmental decision-making procedures referred to in Article 2(2) and shall, for that purpose, be entitled to express comments and opinions when all options are open to the competent authority or authorities before the decision on the request for development consent is taken.</p>
