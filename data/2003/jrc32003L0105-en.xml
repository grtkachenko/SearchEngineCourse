      <head n="1">Directive 2003/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2003 amending Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances</head>
      <p n="2">Directive 2003/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 16 December 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">After consulting the Committee of the Regions,</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 22 October 2003(3),</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Directive 96/82/EC(4) aims at the prevention of major accidents which involve dangerous substances and the limitation of their consequences for man and the environment, with a view to ensuring high levels of protection throughout the Community in a consistent and effective manner.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) In the light of recent industrial accidents and studies on carcinogens and substances dangerous for the environment carried out by the Commission at the Council's request, the scope of Directive 96/82/EC should be extended.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The cyanide spill that polluted the Danube following the accident at Baia Mare in Romania in January 2000 has demonstrated that certain storage and processing activities in mining, especially tailings disposal facilities, including tailing ponds or dams, have potential to produce very serious consequences. The Commission communications on the safe operation of mining activities and on the sixth environment action programme of the European Community have therefore highlighted the need for an extension of the scope of Directive 96/82/EC. In its resolution of 5 July 2001(5) on the Commission Communication on the safe operation of mining activities, the European Parliament also welcomed the extension of the scope of that Directive to cover risks arising from storage and processing activities in mining.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The proposal for a directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries may be a relevant framework for measures relating to those waste management facilities which present an accident risk but which are not covered by the present Directive.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) The "fireworks accident" at Enschede in the Netherlands in May 2000 has demonstrated the major accident potential arising from storage and manufacture of pyrotechnic and explosive substances. The definition of such substances in Directive 96/82/EC should therefore be clarified and simplified.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) The explosion at a fertiliser plant in Toulouse in September 2001 has raised awareness of the accident potential arising from the storage of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers, in particular of material rejected during the manufacturing process or returned to the manufacturer (off-specs). The existing categories of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers in Directive 96/82/EC should therefore be reviewed with a view to include "off-specs" material.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) Directive 96/82/EC should not be applied to sites of end-users where ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers, which on delivery conformed to the specification in that Directive but subsequently have become degraded or contaminated, are temporarily present prior to removal for reprocessing or destruction.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) Studies carried out by the Commission in close cooperation with the Member States support extending the list of carcinogens with appropriate qualifying quantities and significantly lowering the qualifying quantities assigned to substances dangerous for the environment in Directive 96/82/EC.</p>
      <p n="20">(9) For establishments which subsequently fall within the scope of Directive 96/82/EC, it has been shown necessary to introduce minimum periods for notifications and the establishment of major accident prevention policies, safety reports and emergency plans.</p>
      <p n="21">(10) The experience and knowledge of relevant staff in the establishment can greatly assist in the drawing up of emergency plans, and all staff in an establishment and persons likely to be affected should be appropriately informed on safety measures and actions.</p>
      <p n="22">(11) The adoption of Council Decision 2001/792/EC, Euratom of 23 October 2001 establishing a Community mechanism to facilitate reinforced cooperation in civil protection assistance interventions(6) highlights the need to facilitate reinforced cooperation in civil protection assistance interventions.</p>
      <p n="23">(12) It is useful, in order to facilitate land-use planning, to draw up guidelines defining a database to be used for assessing the compatibility between the establishments covered by Directive 96/82/EC and the areas described in Article 12(1) of that Directive.</p>
      <p n="24">(13) There should be an obligation on Member States to supply the Commission with minimum information concerning the establishments covered by Directive 96/82/EC.</p>
      <p n="25">(14) It is appropriate at the same time to clarify certain passages in Directive 96/82/EC.</p>
      <p n="26">(15) The measures provided for in this Directive have been the subject of a public consultation process involving interested parties.</p>
      <p n="27">(16) Directive 96/82/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="28">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>

      <p n="163">(ii) Note 2 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="164">"&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="165">2. An 'explosive' means:</p>
      <p n="166">- a substance or preparation which creates the risk of an explosion by shock, friction, fire or other sources of ignition (risk phrase R2),</p>
      <p n="167">- a substance or preparation which creates extreme risks of explosion by shock, friction, fire or other sources of ignition (risk phrase R3), or</p>
      <p n="168">- a substance, preparation or article covered by Class 1 of the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (UN/ADR), concluded on 30 September 1957, as amended, as transposed by Council Directive 94/55/EC of 21 November 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (3).</p>
      <p n="169">Included in this definition are pyrotechnics, which for the purposes of this Directive are defined as substances (or mixtures of substances) designated to produce heat, light, sound, gas or smoke or a combination of such effects through self-sustained exothermic chemical reactions. Where a substance or preparation is classified by both UN/ADR and risk phase R2 or R3, the UN/ADR classification shall take precedence over assignment of risk phrases.</p>
      <p n="170">Substances and articles of Class 1 are classified in any of the divisions 1.1 to 1.6 in accordance with the UN/ADR classification scheme. The divisions concerned are:</p>
      <p n="171">Division 1.1: 'Substances and articles which have a mass explosion hazard (a mass explosion is an explosion which affects almost the entire load virtually instantaneously).'</p>
      <p n="172">Division 1.2: 'Substances and articles which have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard.'</p>
      <p n="173">Division 1.3:</p>
      <p n="174">'Substances and articles which have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard:</p>
      <p n="175">(a) combustion of which gives rise to considerable radiant heat; or</p>
      <p n="176">(b) which burn one after another, producing minor blast or projection effects or both.'</p>
      <p n="177">Division 1.4: 'Substances and articles which present only a slight risk in the event of ignition or initiation during carriage. The effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire shall not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of virtually the entire contents of the package.'</p>
      <p n="178">Division 1.5: 'Very insensitive substances having a mass explosion hazard which are so insensitive that there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal conditions of carriage. As a minimum requirement they shall not explode in the external fire test.'</p>
      <p n="179">Division 1.6: 'Extremely insensitive articles which do not have a mass explosion hazard. The articles contain only extremely insensitive detonating substances and demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation. The risk is limited to the explosion of a single article.'</p>
      <p n="180">Included in this definition are also explosive or pyrotechnic substances or preparations contained in articles. In the case of articles containing explosive or pyrotechnic substances or preparations, if the quantity of the substance or preparation contained is known, that quantity shall be considered for the purposes of this Directive. If the quantity is not known, then, for the purposes of this Directive, the whole article shall be treated as explosive."</p>
      <p n="181">(iii) in note 3(b)(1), the second indent shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="182">"- substances and preparations which have a flash point lower than 55 ° C and which remain liquid under pressure, where particular processing conditions, such as high pressure or high temperature, may create major-accident hazards;"</p>
      <p n="183">(iv) note 3(c)(2) is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="184">"2. gases which are flammable in contact with air at ambient temperature and pressure (risk phrase R12, second indent), which are in a gaseous or supercritical state, and"</p>
      <p n="185">(v) note 3(c)3 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="186">"3. flammable and highly flammable liquid substances and preparations maintained at a temperature above their boiling point."</p>
      <p n="187">(vi) note 4 is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="188">"4. In the case of an establishment where no individual substance or preparation is present in a quantity above or equal to the relevant qualifying quantities, the following rule shall be applied to determine whether the establishment is covered by the relevant requirements of this Directive.</p>
      <p n="189">This Directive shall apply if the sum</p>
      <p n="190">q1/QU1 + q2/QU2 + q3/QU3 + q4/QU4 + q5/QU5 +... is greater than or equal to 1,</p>
      <p n="191">where qx = the quantity of dangerous substance x (or category of dangerous substances) falling within Parts 1 or 2 of this Annex,</p>
      <p n="192">and QUX = the relevant qualifying quantity for substance or category x from column 3 of Parts 1 or 2.</p>
      <p n="193">This Directive shall apply, with the exception of Articles 9, 11 and 13, if the sum</p>
      <p n="194">q1/QL1 + q2/QL2 + q3/QL3 + q4/QL4 + q5/QL5 +... is greater than or equal to 1,</p>
      <p n="195">where qx = the quantity of dangerous substance x (or category of dangerous substances) falling within Parts 1 or 2 of this Annex,</p>
      <p n="196">and QLX = the relevant qualifying quantity for substance or category x from column 2 of Parts 1 or 2.</p>
      <p n="197">This rule shall be used to assess the overall hazards associated with toxicity, flammability, and eco-toxicity. It must therefore be applied three times:</p>
      <p n="198">(a) for the addition of substances and preparations named in Part 1 and classified as toxic or very toxic, together with substances and preparations falling into categories 1 or 2;</p>
      <p n="199">(b) for the addition of substances and preparations named in Part 1 and classified as oxidising, explosive, flammable, highly flammable, or extremely flammable, together with substances and preparations falling into categories 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b or 8;</p>
      <p n="200">(c) for the addition of substances and preparations named in Part 1 and classified as dangerous for the environment (R50 (including R50/53) or R51/53), together with substances and preparations falling into categories 9(i) or 9(ii);</p>
      <p n="201">The relevant provisions of this Directive apply if any of the sums obtained by (a), (b) or (c) is greater than or equal to 1."</p>
