      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1410/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 7 August 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 laying down certain detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine and establishing a Community code of oenological practices and processes</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2), and in particular Article 46 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 of 24 July 2000 laying down certain detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine and establishing a Community code of oenological practices and processes(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2244/2002(4), lays down restrictions on and certain conditions for the use of substances authorised by Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. In the light of developments in wine-making and trial methods, the limits for L-ascorbic acid and the nutritive salts diammonium phosphate or ammonium sulphate laid down in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 should be amended.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Article 46(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for the adoption of the purity and identification specifications of substances used in oenological practices. Specifications for a large number of these substances are already laid down in Commission Directive 96/77/EC of 2 December 1996 laying down specific purity criteria on food additives other than colours and sweeteners(5), as last amended by Directive 2002/82/EC(6), which, in the case of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, lays down stricter criteria than the requirements and purity criteria in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000. As a result, the horizontal legislation laying down the purity criteria for food additives should be made to apply to the wine sector and Annex V deleted.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) In the wine-growing regions in wine-growing zone A listed in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000, the official designation of the region "Rheinpfalz" has been changed to "Pfalz". The new designation for the region should be used in that Article.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Italian quality wines psr entitled to bear the designation of origin Colli orientali del Friuli accompanied by the term "Picolit" have a residual sugar content greater than 5 grams per litre and for their preservation in good quality conditions require a sulphur dioxide content above the general limit of 260 mg/l but less than 300 mg/l. Those wines should therefore be added to the list in Annex XII.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The aforementioned quality wines psr Colli orientali del Friuli accompanied by the term "Picolit" are made using special methods and have a total alcoholic strength by volume greater than 13 % vol. and normally have a volatile acid content above the limits laid down in Annex V(B) to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 but less than 25 milliequivalents per litre. Those wines should therefore be added to the list in Annex XIII.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 provides that the usual methods of analysis described in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 of 17 September 1990 determining Community methods for the analysis of wines(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 440/2003(8), are repealed from 1 August 2003. Several of those usual methods of analysis are undergoing technical and scientific evaluation and a validation study of their precision and accuracy with a view to their recognition as reference methods. Since that work has not yet been completed, the date of repeal of certain provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2676/1990 should be postponed for a further period of two years pending the final outcome of the studies in progress.</p>
      <p n="15">(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>

Where necessary, those purity criteria shall be supplemented by the specific requirements provided for in this Regulation."</p>
      <p n="22">2. In the penultimate indent of Article 8, "Rheinpfalz" is replaced by "Pfalz".</p>
      <p n="23">3. In Article 44(2), "1 August 2003" is replaced by "1 August 2005".</p>
