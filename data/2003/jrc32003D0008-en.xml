      <p n="2">Commission Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 23 December 2002</p>
      <p n="4">implementing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 as regards the clearance of vacancies and applications for employment</p>
      <p n="5">(notified under document number C(2002) 5236)</p>
      <p n="6">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="7">(2003/8/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2434/92(2), and in particular Article 44 thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Much progress has been made since the initial launch of the European Employment Services network (EURES) established by Commission Decision 93/569/EEC(3), in order to implement Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) In the light of the experience gained since 1993, and taking into account and consolidating recent developments in the EURES environment, the network should now be reinforced and fully integrated into the activities of employment services of the Member States. The current division of responsibilities and the decision-making procedures should be redesigned.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) With a view to the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, full account should be taken of the implementation of EURES in the acceding countries while ensuring that the system remains efficient and manageable.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The opportunities afforded by the emerging information and communication technology tools for further enhancing and rationalising the services provided should also be taken into account.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) To this end, EURES should be consolidated and strengthened as a key tool for the monitoring of mobility, for the support of the free movement of workers and the integration of the European labour markets, and for informing citizens about the relevant Community legislation.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) There is a need to underpin occupational and geographic mobility in line with the European Employment Strategy, in the interests of implementing the Action Plan for skills and mobility(4) and the Council Resolution of 3 June 2002 on the same issue(5).</p>
      <p n="18">(7) For the sake of clarity, it is advisable to re-establish the European Employment Services network whilst defining more precisely its composition, constitution and functions. This operation will entail the replacement of Decision 93/569/EEC.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Technical Committee on freedom of movement for workers,</p>
      <p n="20">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="21">Article 1</p>
      <p n="22">The EURES network</p>
      <p n="23">The Commission, the employment services of the Member States and any further national partners which they may have, shall create a European network of services, designated EURES (EURopean Employment Services) responsible for developing the exchange of information and cooperation provided for in Part II of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68.</p>
      <p n="24">Article 2</p>
      <p n="25">Objectives</p>

      <p n="27">In particular, for the benefit of job seekers, workers and employers, EURES shall seek to promote:</p>
      <p n="28">(a) the development of European labour markets open and accessible for all;</p>
      <p n="29">(b) the transnational, interregional and cross-border exchange of vacancies and job applications;</p>
      <p n="30">(c) transparency and information exchange on the European labour markets, including on living conditions and on the opportunities for acquisition of skills;</p>
      <p n="31">(d) the development of methodologies and indicators for this purpose.</p>
