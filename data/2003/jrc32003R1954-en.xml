      <head n="1">Council Regulation (EC) No 1954/2003 of 4 November 2003 on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources and modifying Regulation (EC) No 2847/93 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 685/95 and (EC) No 2027/95</head>
      <p n="2">Council Regulation (EC) No 1954/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 4 November 2003</p>
      <p n="4">on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources and modifying Regulation (EC) No 2847/93 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 685/95 and (EC) No 2027/95</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 37 and 299(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy(3) provides that the Council shall establish Community measures governing access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) The regime of access to certain areas and resources defined in the Articles 156 to 166 and Articles 347 to 353 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal has expired on 31 December 2002. Consequently, certain provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 685/95 of 27 March 1995, on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources(4), and Council Regulation (EC) No 2027/95 of 15 June 1995, establishing a system for the management of fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources(5) need to be adapted to the new legal situation.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Other provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 685/95 and (EC) No 2027/95 are designed to establish a general system for the management of fishing effort in order to prevent an increase in fishing effort and are not related to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal. Those provisions are important for fisheries management and should be maintained.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) In order to ensure that there is no increase in the overall levels of existing fishing effort, it is necessary to establish a new fishing effort management regime in ICES areas V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X and CECAF divisions 34.1.1, 34.1.2 and 34.2.0. This regime shall limit fishing effort on the basis of the fishing effort deployed in these fisheries during the period 1998 to 2002.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) In order to ensure consistency between different fishing effort management rules, the general fishing effort limitation provided for in this Regulation should be reviewed whenever the Council adopts fishing effort management rules for fisheries in the same area or part of it, as part of a recovery plan. A review of the implementation of the present scheme by December 2006 would also allow the Council to reassess the situation.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) It is necessary for the protection of the sensitive biological situation of the waters around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands and the preservation of the local economy of these islands, having regard to their structural, social and economic situation, to limit certain fishing activities in those waters to vessels registered in the ports of these islands. A review of these measures by December 2006 would allow the Council to reassess the situation.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) An area to the South and West of Ireland has been identified as an area of high concentration of juvenile hake. This area has been made subject to special restrictions on the use of demersal gear. For the same conservation purpose it should also be subject to specific effort limitation requirements within the general system described above. A review of these requirements by December 2008 would allow the Council to reassess the situation.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) It is the responsibility of flag Member States to adopt measures to regulate fishing effort; as a result, it is necessary to ensure transparency and equity of management and monitoring procedures.</p>
      <p n="18">(9) Taking account of the special conservation requirements of species having a geographic distribution that extends into the waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of more than one Member State, Member States should be authorised to limit fishing activities by vessels flying their flag to specific gear, seasons and areas.</p>
      <p n="19">(10) It should be possible for the Commission to adjust the maximum fishing effort limits, based on a justified request from a Member State, to allow it to fully utilise its fishing possibilities.</p>
      <p n="20">(11) As a consequence of the change in the fishing effort management regime it is necessary to make corresponding changes in Titles IIA and III of the Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993, establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy(6).</p>
      <p n="21">(12) In order to ensure legal certainty, to avoid alterations in the current balance in the areas and resources involved and to guarantee that the fishing effort deployed is in balance with available resources, Regulations (EC) No 685/95 and (EC) No 2027/95 should be repealed.</p>
      <p n="22">(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7),</p>

      <p n="86">4. Member States, when submitting the list of vessels referred to in Article 7, shall highlight those changes that have been made from the last list notified under Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2092/98 of 30 September 1998, concerning the declaration of fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources(11).</p>
      <p n="87">Article 11</p>
      <p n="88">Decision-making</p>
      <p n="89">1. On the basis of the information referred to in Article 10 and after close consultation with the Member States concerned the Commission shall submit to the Council, by 29 February 2004, a proposal for a Regulation fixing the maximum annual fishing effort for each Member State and for each area and fishery defined in Articles 3 and 6.</p>
      <p n="90">2. The Council, acting by qualified majority on the proposal from the Commission, shall, by 31 May 2004, decide on the maximum annual fishing effort referred to in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p n="91">The Regulation, which will be adopted by the Council, may provide for the adoption of implementing rules, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.</p>
      <p n="92">3. Should the Council fail to reach a decision by 31 May 2004, the Commission shall adopt, by 31 July 2004, a Regulation fixing the maximum annual fishing effort for each Member State and for each area and fishery defined in Articles 3 and 6, on the basis of the proposal referred to in paragraph 1, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.</p>
      <p n="93">Article 12</p>
      <p n="94">Adaptations</p>
      <p n="95">1. Upon request of a Member State, the maximum annual fishing effort fixed in the Regulation under Article 11(2) or (3) may be adjusted by the Commission, either by an increase of the maximum fishing effort in a particular area or division, or by a shift of fishing effort between areas or divisions, allowing the Member State to take up fully its fishing possibilities, in the case of species subject to TACs, or to pursue fisheries not subject to such limitations. The request shall be accompanied by information on the lack of full utilisation of quotas and, for stocks not subject to TACs, scientific information on the stock situation. Decisions shall be taken by the Commission within one month of receipt of the request, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.</p>
      <p n="96">2. The maximum fishing effort referred to in Article 11 shall be adapted by the Member States concerned in view of exchanges of quotas carried out pursuant to Article 20(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 and reallocations and/or deductions made pursuant to Article 23(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 and Article 21(4), Article 23(1) and Article 32(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93, in conformity with paragraph 3 of this Article.</p>
      <p n="97">3. Where Member States decide to exchange all or part of the fishing opportunities allocated to them, they shall notify the Commission not only of that exchange expressed in fishing quotas but also expressed in fishing effort relating thereto, as agreed between them.</p>
      <p n="98">In the event of reallocations and/or deductions of quotas, the Member States shall notify the Commission of the fishing effort corresponding to such reallocations and/or deductions.</p>
