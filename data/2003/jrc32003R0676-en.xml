      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1756/2002(2), and in particular Articles 3 and 9r thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1334/2001 of 2 July 2001 concerning the provisional authorisation of a new additive in feedingstuffs(3), provisionally authorised the use of the additive potassium diformate for use as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions set out in that Regulation.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Directive 70/524/EEC requires authorisations for growth promoters to be linked to the person responsible for putting them into circulation.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) The Commission has been notified that the person responsible for putting the additive potassium diformate into circulation has changed, and is now BASF Aktiengesellschaft.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) The person responsible for putting that additive into circulation has submitted new data in order to obtain approval for higher maximum concentrations of the additive in feed.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition has delivered a favourable opinion with regard to the safety of the additive, under new conditions of use.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) Regulation (EC) No 1334/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
      <p n="19">The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2001 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 14 April 2003.</p>
