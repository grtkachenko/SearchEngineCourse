      <p n="2">Commission Directive 2003/81/EC</p>
      <p n="3">of 5 September 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include molinate, thiram and ziram as active substances</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/79/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2266/2000(4), establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes molinate, thiram and ziram.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. By Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member State for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), the following rapporteur Member States were designated, which in turn submitted the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the Commission in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92. For molinate the rapporteur Member State was Portugal, and all relevant information was submitted on 30 November 1998. For thiram the Rapporteur Member State was Belgium, and the relevant information was submitted on 15 January 1998. For ziram the rapporteur Member State was Belgium and the relevant information was submitted on 9 June 1998.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Those assessment reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) The reviews of all active substances were finalised on 4 July 2003 in the format of the Commission review reports for molinate, thiram and ziram.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) The reviews of molinate, thiram and ziram did not reveal any open questions or concerns, which would have required a consultation of the Scientific Committee on Plants.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing molinate, thiram or ziram may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will resulting from the inclusion.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period within which to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards plant protection products containing molinate, thiram or ziram, and in particular, to review existing authorisations to ensure that the conditions regarding those active substances set out in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are satisfied. A longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete dossier of each plant protection product in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.</p>
      <p n="18">(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.</p>
      <p n="19">(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
