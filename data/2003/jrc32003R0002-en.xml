      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) The Council is in the process of concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part, which was signed at Luxembourg on 29 October 2001 (hereinafter referred to as "the Stabilisation and Association Agreement").</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Meanwhile on 29 October 2001 the Council concluded an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part(1) (hereinafter referred to as "Interim Agreement").

      <p n="11">(3) Regulation (EC) No 2248/2001(2) lays down certain procedures for applying some provisions of these Agreements. It is, however, necessary to lay down procedures for applying certain additional provisions of these Agreements.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 December 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(3).</p>
      <p n="13">(5) With regard to trade defence measures, it is appropriate to lay down specific provisions concerning the general rules provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(4).</p>
      <p n="14">(6) This Regulation should continue to apply after entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement,</p>

      <p n="52">Article 7e</p>
      <p n="53">Competition</p>

      <p n="55">2.

      <p n="56">Article 7f</p>

      <p n="59">- the absence of administrative cooperation, such as the failure to provide names and addresses of customs or government authorities responsible for issuing and checking certificates of origin, or specimens of stamps used to authenticate the certificates, or the failure to update that information where appropriate,</p>
      <p n="60">- a repeated lack or inadequacy of action in verifying the originating status of products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of Protocol 4 of the Agreements and identifying or preventing contravention of the rules of origin,</p>
      <p n="61">- a repeated refusal or undue delay to carry out, at the request of the Commission, subsequent verification of the proof of origin and to communicate its results in time,</p>
      <p n="62">- a repeated refusal or undue delay to obtain the authorisation to conduct administrative and investigative cooperation missions in Croatia, in order to verify the authenticity of documents or the accuracy of information relevant for granting the preferential treatment granted under the Agreements, or to carry out or arrange for appropriate inquiries to identify or prevent contravention of the rules of origin,</p>
      <p n="63">- a repeated failure to comply with the provisions of Protocol 5 on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters insofar as it is relevant to the application of the trade provisions of the Interim Agreement, and thereafter the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
      <p n="64">2. Where the Commission, on the basis of information provided by a Member State or on its own initiative, finds that the conditions laid down in Article 30 of the Interim Agreement, and thereafter Article 43 of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, are fulfilled it shall:</p>
      <p n="65">- inform the Council,</p>
      <p n="66">- enter immediately into consultations with Croatia, to find an appropriate solution as provided for in those provisions.</p>
      <p n="67">In addition, it may:</p>
      <p n="68">- call on the Member States to take such precautionary measures as are necessary in order to safeguard the Community's financial interests,</p>
      <p n="69">- publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities stating that there are grounds for reasonable doubts about the application of the provisions relevant to the application of Article 30 of the Interim Agreement, and thereafter of Article 43 of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
      <p n="70">3. Pending a mutually satisfactory solution having been reached in the consultations referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission may decide on other appropriate measures it deems necessary in accordance with Article 30 of the Interim Agreement, and thereafter Article 43 of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as well as with the procedure referred to in paragraph 5.</p>
      <p n="71">4. The Commission shall be assisted by the Customs Code Committee set up by Article 248a of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92(8).</p>

      <p n="77">Article 2</p>
      <p n="78">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
