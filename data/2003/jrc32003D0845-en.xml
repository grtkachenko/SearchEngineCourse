      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC(1), and in particular Article 18 thereof,</p>

      <p n="13">(2) On the basis of information received, Bulgaria may now be regarded as a blue tongue-free country. The situation in Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro (the former Yugoslavia) remains unchanged.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) In the interest of clarity of Community legislation, Decision 2001/706/EC should therefore be repealed and replaced by this Decision.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>

      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">1. By way of derogation to Article 1(1) Member States may allow import of live animals of the blue tongue-susceptible species having transited through Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, provided that this does not endanger the status in relation to blue tongue of the Member State concerned</p>
      <p n="22">2. The Member States shall keep the Commission informed about the criteria applied for granting the derogation provided for in paragraph 1.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
      <p n="24">Decision 2001/706/EC is repealed.</p>
      <p n="25">References to the repealed Decision shall be construed as references to this Decision.</p>
