      <p n="2">Commission Directive 2003/75/EC</p>
      <p n="3">of 29 July 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Annex I to Council Directive 98/18/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger ships</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships(1), and in particular Article 8(b) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Council Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships applies to new and existing ships on domestic service according to the requirements of Annex I.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Chapter III, section 5-1 of Annex I to Directive 98/18/EC required modification to life-rafts, fast rescue boats, means of rescue and life jackets on existing ro-ro ships not later than the date of the first periodical survey after 1 July 2000.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Commission Directive 2002/25/EC of 5 March 2002 amending Council Directive 98/18/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger ships(2) required further modification of the same equipment by 1 January 2003.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) The corresponding SOLAS requirement allows for modifications of existing ships to take place at the time of major repairs, alterations or replacement of life-saving equipment.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) Directive 98/18/EC should therefore be amended to allow a reasonable deadline for applying these specific new requirements to existing ro-ro ships.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Safe Seas, set up pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002(3),</p>

      <p n="18">Chapter III, section 5-1 of Annex I to Directive 98/18/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive within six months after its date of entry into force at the latest. They shall forthwith notify the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="21">When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.</p>
      <p n="22">2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the provisions of national law, which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 3</p>
      <p n="24">This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 4</p>
      <p n="26">This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>

      <p n="36">CLASS B, C AND D RO-RO SHIPS CONSTRUCTED BEFORE 1 JANUARY 2003:.</p>
      <p n="37">1 Ro-ro passenger ships constructed before 1 January 2003, shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs.6.2,.6.3,.6.4,.7,.8 and.9 not later than the date of the first periodical survey after 1 January 2006.</p>
      <p n="38">Prior to this date, paragraphs.2,.3,.4 and.5 shall apply for ro-ro ships constructed before 1 January 2003.</p>
      <p n="39">Notwithstanding the above, when life-saving appliances or arrangements on such ships are replaced or such ships undergo repairs, alterations or modifications of a major character which involve replacement of, or any addition to, their existing life saving appliances or arrangements, such life-saving appliances or arrangements shall comply with the relevant requirements of paragraphs.6,.7,.8 and.9..</p>

      <p n="46">Alternatively, the ship shall carry automatically self-righting life-rafts or canopied reversible life-rafts in addition to its normal complement of life-rafts, of such aggregate capacity as will accommodate at least 50 % of the persons not accommodated in lifeboats. This additional life-raft capacity shall be determined on the basis of the difference between the total number of persons on board and the number of persons accommodated in lifeboats. Every such life-raft shall be approved by the administration of the flag State having regard to the recommendations adopted by the IMO with MSC/Circ. 809..</p>

      <p n="51">4 In the case where the arrangement or size of an existing ro-ro passenger ship is such as to prevent the installation of the fast rescue boat required by paragraph.3.1, the fast rescue boat may be installed in place of an existing lifeboat which is accepted as a rescue boat or boat for use in an emergency, provided that all of the following conditions are met:.</p>
      <p n="52">1 the fast rescue boat installed is served by a launching appliance complying with the provisions of paragraph.3.2;.</p>
      <p n="53">2 the capacity of the survival craft lost by the above substitution is compensated by the installation of life-rafts capable of carrying at least an equal number of persons served by the lifeboat replaced; and.</p>
      <p n="54">3 such life-rafts are served by the existing launching appliances or marine evacuation systems..</p>
      <p n="55">4 Means of rescue.</p>
