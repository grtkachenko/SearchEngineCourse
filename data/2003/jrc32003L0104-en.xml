      <p n="11">(3) The Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition (SCAN) delivered an opinion on the use of this product in feedingstuffs on 25 April 2003, which concludes that the isopropyl ester of the hydroxylated analogue of methionine does not present a risk on human health, animal health or the environment.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The assessment of the request for authorisation submitted in respect of the isopropyl ester of the hydroxylated analogue of methionine shows that this product meets the requirements laid down in Article 6(2) of Directive 82/471/EEC, under the conditions set out in the Annex to this Directive. This product should therefore be authorised.</p>

      <p n="19">2. When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.</p>
      <p n="20">3. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 3</p>
      <p n="22">This Directive shall enter into force on the seventh day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
