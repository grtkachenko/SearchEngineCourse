      <p n="13">(2) A dossier for the active substance potassium phosphite was submitted by Luxembourg Industries (Pamol) Ltd to the French authorities on 22 August 2002 with an application to obtain its inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. For the active substance acequinocyl a dossier was submitted by Agro-Kanesho Co.

      <p n="20">The dossiers concerning the active substances identified in the Annex to this Decision, which were submitted to the Commission and the Member States with a view to obtaining the inclusion of those substances in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, satisfy in principle the data and information requirements set out in Annex II to Directive 91/414/EEC.</p>
      <p n="21">The dossiers also satisfy the data and information requirements set out in Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC in respect of one plant-protection product containing the active substance, taking into account the uses proposed.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 2</p>
