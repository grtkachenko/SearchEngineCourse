      <p n="35">The aims of the criteria</p>
      <p n="36">These criteria aim in particular at promoting:</p>

      <p n="38">- the reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by encouraging the durability, recyclability and maintainability of a vacuum cleaner (hereinafter referred to as the product),</p>
      <p n="39">- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of hazardous substances by reducing the use of such substances.</p>
      <p n="40">The criteria encourage the implementation of best practice (optimal environmental use) and enhance consumers' environmental awareness. Furthermore, the marking of plastic components encourages recycling.</p>
      <p n="41">The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of vacuum cleaners that are produced with low environmental impact.</p>
