      <p n="33">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="34">QUESTIONNAIRE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DIRECTIVE 96/61/EC CONCERNING INTEGRATED POLLUTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL (IPPC)</p>
      <p n="35">1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION</p>
      <p n="36">1.1. What are the main changes to national legislation and to the licensing system that were necessary in order to meet the overall aim of achieving integrated prevention and control of pollution arising from the activities listed in Annex I to the Directive?</p>
      <p n="37">2. COVERAGE OF ACTIVITIES AND INSTALLATIONS</p>
      <p n="38">2.1. For each subheading in Annex I (1.1, 2.3(a), 6.4(b) etc.), how many installations fall into the categories set out below:</p>
      <p n="39">- all existing installations within the meaning of Article 2(4), in operation at the end of the reporting period,</p>
      <p n="40">- existing installations for which a substantial change was notified to the competent authority and for which a permit was granted during the reporting period,</p>
      <p n="41">- new installations (including those not yet in operation) for which a permit was granted during the reporting period.</p>
      <p n="42">In answering this question, it should be noted that the same installation could carry out activities falling under different subheadings. All relevant activities should be indicated (even if this means that the installation is counted more than once). Since many chemical installations carry out more than one activity as defined in the subheadings of heading 4, only the overall figures for heading 4 should be given (i.e. no figures for individual subheadings).</p>
      <p n="43">Table 1</p>
      <p n="44">Categories of activities for which the total number of installations shall be reported</p>
      <p n="45">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="46">2.2. What is the total number of IPPC installations at the end of the reporting period?</p>
      <p n="47">In answering this question, care should be taken not to count the same installation more than once, even if it carries out several Annex I activities.</p>
      <p n="48">3. BASIC OPERATOR OBLIGATIONS</p>
      <p n="49">3.1. What measures have been taken to provide that the competent authorities ensure that the installations are operated in accordance with the general principles set out in Article 3?</p>

      <p n="53">5.1. How does national law ensure that permit applications contain all the information required by Article 6?</p>
      <p n="54">6. COORDINATION OF THE PERMITTING PROCEDURE AND CONDITIONS</p>
      <p n="55">6.1. Which competent authority or authorities are involved in permitting IPPC installations?</p>
      <p n="56">6.2. How does national law ensure that the permitting procedure and conditions are fully coordinated where more than one competent authority is involved? How does this coordination work in practice?</p>
      <p n="57">7. PERMIT CONDITIONS</p>
      <p n="58">7.1. Completeness of permit conditions</p>
      <p n="59">7.1.1. How does national law ensure that the permit contains all the requirements specified in Article 9? In particular, give details on how each of the following items is provided for:</p>
      <p n="60">- limit values for emissions to air and water,</p>
      <p n="61">- minimisation of long-distance or transboundary pollution,</p>
      <p n="62">- protection of soil and groundwater,</p>
      <p n="63">- waste management,</p>

      <p n="68">- site restoration upon definitive cessation of activities (requirement for "satisfactory state"),</p>
      <p n="69">- special provisions for installations under subheading 6.6 of Annex I.</p>
      <p n="70">7.2. Appropriateness and adequacy of permit conditions</p>
      <p n="71">7.2.1. What are the legislative provisions, procedures and criteria for setting emission limit values and other permit conditions, ensuring that they lead to a high level of protection for the environment as a whole? Have any specific guidelines for competent authorities been issued? If so, provide information on the type of guidelines issued.</p>
      <p n="72">7.2.2. What kind of (binding or non-binding) guidance exists in Member States for determining best available techniques?</p>

      <p n="74">7.2.4. How useful, as a source of information for determining emission limit values, equivalent parameters and technical measures based on the best available techniques, is the information published by the Commission pursuant to Article 16(2)? How could it be improved?</p>
      <p n="75">7.2.5. What measures have been taken to ensure that the emission limit values and the equivalent parameters and technical measures referred to in Article 9(3) are based on the best available techniques, without prescribing the use of any technique or specific technology, but taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation, its geographical location, and the local environmental conditions?</p>
      <p n="76">7.2.6. What kind of (binding or non-binding) guidance exists in Member States concerning the release monitoring requirements to be included in the permit?</p>
      <p n="77">7.2.7. What is your experience regarding the interface between the permit requirements under the IPPC Directive and the Directive establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC?</p>
      <p n="78">Note:</p>
      <p n="79">Member States are not required to give any answer to this question if the Community greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme has not started by 1 January 2005 as planned.</p>
      <p n="80">7.3. Available representative data</p>
      <p n="81">7.3.1. Provide available representative data on the limit values laid down by specific category of activities in accordance with Annex I and, if appropriate, the best available techniques from which those values are derived.

      <p n="86">- conditions concerning the protection of soil and ground water, waste management, efficient use of energy, release monitoring requirements, prevention of accidents and limitation of their consequences, measures relating to abnormal operating conditions and site restoration upon definitive cessation of activities,</p>
      <p n="87">- conditions relating to environmental management systems.</p>
      <p n="88">8. GENERAL BINDING RULES</p>
      <p n="89">8.1. Does national law contain the possibility of laying down certain requirements for certain categories of installations in general binding rules instead of including them in individual permit conditions?</p>
