      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1843/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 17 October 2003</p>
      <p n="4">fixing depreciation percentages to be applied when agricultural products are bought in for the 2004 financial year</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 of 2 August 1978 laying down general rules for the financing of interventions by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1259/96(2), and in particular the second sentence of Article 8(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78, depreciation of agricultural products stored in public intervention warehouses must take place when they are bought in. The depreciation percentage must not exceed the difference between the buying-in price and the foreseeable disposal price for each of these products.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Pursuant to Article 8(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78, the Commission may restrict depreciation at the time of buying-in to a proportion of this depreciation percentage, but such proportion may not be less than 70 % of total depreciation. Coefficients should be fixed for certain products for the 2004 financial year, to be applied by the intervention agencies to the monthly buying-in values of these products, so that the agencies can establish the depreciation amounts.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the EAGGF Committee,</p>
      <p n="12">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="13">Article 1</p>
      <p n="14">1. In respect of the products listed in the Annex, which, having been bought in by public intervention, have entered storage or been taken over by the intervention agencies between 1 October 2003 and 30 September 2004, the authorities shall depreciate their value to account for the difference between the buying-in prices and the foreseeable selling prices of the relevant products.</p>
      <p n="15">2. To establish the amounts of the depreciation, the intervention agencies shall apply to the values of the products bought in every month the coefficients set out in the Annex.</p>
      <p n="16">3. The expenditure amounts determined in this way shall be notified to the Commission under the declarations established pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 296/96(3).</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="19">It shall apply from 1 October 2003.</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="21">Done at Brussels, 17 October 2003.</p>
      <p n="22">For the Commission</p>
