      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1972/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 10 November 2003</p>
      <p n="4">on transitional measures to be adopted in respect of trade in agricultural products on account of the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, and in particular Article 41, first paragraph, thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Transitional measures should be adopted in order to avoid the risk of deflection of trade, affecting the common organisation of agricultural markets due to the accession of 10 new States to the European Union on 1 May 2004.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) In accordance with the rules set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 500/2003(2), products are not entitled to refund unless they have left the customs territory of the Community within 60 days of acceptance of the export declaration. The obligation to leave the customs territory of the Community within 60 days of acceptance of the export declaration is also a primary requirement for releasing the security linked to the licence under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(4). Since the internal borders will be removed upon accession, products exported from the Community of Fifteen must have left the customs territory of the Community by 30 April 2004 at the latest in all cases, including where the export declaration has been accepted less than 60 days before the date of accession.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Trade deflections liable to disrupt the market organisations often involve products moved artificially with a view to enlargement and do not form part of the normal stocks of the State concerned. Surplus stocks may also result from national production. Provisions should, therefore, be made for deterrent charges to be levied on surplus stocks in the new Member States.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) It is necessary to prevent goods in respect of which export refunds were paid before 1 May 2004 from benefiting from a second refund when exported to third countries after 30 April 2004.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are necessary and appropriate and should be applied in uniform fashion.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of all the Management Committees concerned,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">Definitions</p>
      <p n="19">For the purposes of this Regulation:</p>
      <p n="20">(a) "Community of Fifteen" means the Community as constituted on 30 April 2004;</p>
      <p n="21">(b) "new Member States" means the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia;</p>
      <p n="22">(c) "enlarged Community" means the Community as constituted on 1 May 2004;</p>
      <p n="23">(d) "products" means agricultural products and/or goods not included in Annex I of the EC Treaty;</p>
      <p n="24">(e) "production refund" means the refund granted pursuant to Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92(5) or Article 7 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95(6) or Article 7 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001(7).</p>
      <p n="25">Article 2</p>
      <p n="26">Exports from the Community of Fifteen</p>
      <p n="27">Where, for the products intended for export from the Community of Fifteen to one of the new Member States for which an export declaration has been accepted by 30 April 2004 at the latest, the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 have not been complied with by that date, the beneficiary shall reimburse any refund received in accordance with Article 52 of that Regulation.</p>
      <p n="28">Article 3</p>
      <p n="29">Suspensive regime</p>
      <p n="30">1. This Article shall apply by way of derogation from Annex IV, Chapter 5, to the Act of Accession and from Articles 20 and 214 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(8).</p>
      <p n="31">2. Products listed in Article 4(5), which before 1 May 2004 have been in free circulation in the Community of Fifteen or in a new Member State and on 1 May 2004 are in temporary storage or under one of the customs treatments or procedures referred to in Article 4(15)(b) and (16)(b) to (g) of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 in the enlarged Community, or which are in transport after having been the subject of export formalities within the enlarged Community shall be charged with the erga omnes import duty rate applicable on the date of release for free circulation.</p>
      <p n="32">The first subparagraph shall not apply to products exported from the Community of Fifteen if the importer gives evidence that no export refund has been sought for the products of the country of export. Upon the importer's request, the exporter shall arrange to obtain an endorsement by the competent authority on the export declaration that an export refund has not been sought for the products of the country of export.</p>
      <p n="33">3. Products listed in Article 4(5) coming from third countries which are under inward processing referred to in Article 4(16)(d) or temporary admission referred to in Article 4(16)(f) of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 in a new Member State on 1 May 2004 and which are released for free circulation on or after that date, shall be charged with the import duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation to products coming from third countries.</p>
      <p n="34">Article 4</p>
      <p n="35">Charges on goods in free circulation</p>
      <p n="36">1. Without prejudice to Annex IV, Chapter 4, to the Act of Accession, and where stricter legislation does not apply at national level, the new Member States shall levy charges on holders of surplus stocks at 1 May 2004 of products in free circulation.</p>
      <p n="37">2. In order to determine the surplus stock of each holder, the new Member States shall take into account, in particular:</p>
      <p n="38">(a) averages of stocks available in the years preceding accession;</p>
      <p n="39">(b) the pattern of trade in the years preceding accession;</p>
      <p n="40">(c) the circumstances in which stocks were built up.</p>
      <p n="41">The notion surplus stocks applies to products imported into the new Member States or originating from the new Member States. The notion surplus stocks applies also to products intended for the market of the new Member States.</p>
      <p n="42">The recording of the stocks shall be performed on the basis of the Combined Nomenclature applicable on 1 May 2004.</p>
      <p n="43">3. The amount of the charge referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined by the erga omnes import duty rate applicable on 1 May 2004. The revenue of the charge collected by national authorities shall be assigned to the national budget of the new Member State.</p>
      <p n="44">4. In order to ensure that the charge referred to in paragraph 1 is correctly applied, the new Member States shall, without delay, carry out an inventory of stocks available as at 1 May 2004. For this purpose the new Member State shall notify the Commission of the quantity of products in surplus stocks, except of those quantities in public stocks as referred to in Article 5, by 31 July 2004 at the latest.</p>
      <p n="45">5. This Article shall apply to products covered by the following CN codes:</p>
