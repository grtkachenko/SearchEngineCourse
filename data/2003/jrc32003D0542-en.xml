      <p n="12">(1) Commission Decision No 2000/96/EC of 22 December 1999 on the communicable diseases to be progressively covered by the Community network under Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2) lists the communicable diseases and special health issues to be progressively covered by epidemiological surveillance.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) It is necessary to specify those communicable diseases and special health issues for which dedicated surveillance networks have already been put in place in order to ensure the effective operation of those networks and that the designated structures/authorities are aware of their responsibilities.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Each Member State should nominate contact points, which may be institutions, services, departments or other bodies, to ensure that the Community network is informed regularly and without delay of events, data, statistics, and information regarding communicable diseases and special health issues covered by dedicated surveillance networks. One of those contact points or another appropriate body should act as a coordinating structure.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) Operating procedures of the dedicated surveillance network should be communicated to the Community network in order to improve comparability and compatibility of data.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 7 of Decision No 2119/98/EC,</p>

      <p n="23">Each dedicated surveillance network will collect relevant surveillance data and information, will ensure coordination within its structure, and will without delay communicate them to the Community network.</p>
      <p n="24">The dedicated surveillance network will also provide the Community network with its operating procedures, addressing at least the topics listed in Annex III."</p>
