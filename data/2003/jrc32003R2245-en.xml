      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2245/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 19 December 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in ovine and caprine animals</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(1), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 23 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down rules for the monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in ovine and caprine animals.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Separate sample sizes should be set for ovine and caprine animals to make it easier to interpret results of testing for TSEs.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Monitoring of large numbers of ovine animals slaughtered for human consumption in Member States with large sheep populations has made it possible to estimate the prevalence of TSEs in those populations. The level of monitoring in large sheep populations should therefore be reduced. Monitoring of ovine animals slaughtered for human consumption in Member States with small sheep populations provides limited information and should therefore no longer be compulsory.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Monitoring of sufficiently large numbers of caprine animals slaughtered for human consumption to detect the likely prevalence of TSEs in this group is difficult or impractical in most Member States. Monitoring in that group should therefore no longer be compulsory.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) Monitoring of dead-on-farm stock in both ovine and caprine animals should be increased, to provide information on prevalence of TSE and to aid eradication of the disease. Member States should take measures to ensure that infected animals are not diverted away from sampling.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly. For practical reasons, it is appropriate to replace the amended Annex III as a whole.</p>
      <p n="15">(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="17">Article 1</p>
      <p n="18">Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="21">It shall apply from 1 January 2004.</p>
      <p n="22">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="23">Done at Brussels, 19 December 2003.</p>
      <p n="24">For the Commission</p>

      <p n="58">In addition to the testing referred to in points 2 to 4, Member States may on a voluntary basis decide to test other bovine animals on their territory, in particular where those animals originate from countries with indigenous BSE, have consumed potentially contaminated feedingstuffs or were born or derived from BSE infected dams.</p>
      <p n="59">6. Measures following testing</p>
      <p n="60">6.1. Where an animal slaughtered for human consumption has been selected for testing for BSE, the health marking provided for in Chapter XI of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC shall not be carried out on the carcase of that animal until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained.</p>
      <p n="61">6.2. Member States may derogate from the provisions of point 6.1 where an official system is in place in the slaughterhouse ensuring that no parts of examined animals bearing the health mark leave the slaughterhouse until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained.</p>
      <p n="62">6.3. All parts of the body of an animal tested for BSE including the hide shall be retained under official control until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained, unless they are disposed of in accordance with Article 4(2)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3).</p>
      <p n="63">6.4. All parts of the body of an animal found positive to the rapid test including the hide shall be disposed of in accordance with Article 4(2)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, apart from material to be retained in conjunction with the records provided for in Chapter B(III).</p>

      <p n="74">- slaughtered for human consumption,</p>
      <p n="75">shall be tested in accordance with the sample sizes indicated in table A and table B respectively. The sampling shall be representative for each region and season. The sample selection shall be designed with a view to avoiding the over-representation of any group as regards the origin, age, breed, production type or any other characteristic. The age of the animal shall be estimated based on dentition, obvious signs of maturity or other reliable information. Multiple sampling in the same flock shall be avoided, where possible. The Member State shall put in place a system to check, on a targeted or other basis, that animals are not being diverted from sampling</p>
      <p n="76">Member States may decide to exclude remote areas with a low animal density, where no collection of dead animals is organised, from the sampling. Member States making use of this derogation shall inform the Commission thereof, and submit a list of the derogated areas.

Where an ovine or caprine animal slaughtered for human consumption has been selected for testing for TSE, the health marking provided for in Chapter XI of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC shall not be carried out on the carcase of that animal until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained.</p>
      <p n="92">6.2. Member States may derogate from point 6.1 where an official system is in place in the slaughterhouse ensuring that no parts of examined animals bearing the health mark leave the slaughterhouse until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained.</p>
      <p n="93">6.3. All parts of the body of a tested animal including the hide shall be retained under official control until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained, unless they are disposed of in accordance with Article 4.2(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002.</p>
      <p n="94">6.4. All parts of the body of an animal found positive to the rapid test including the hide shall be disposed of in accordance with Article 4.(2)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, apart from material to be retained in conjunction with the records provided for in Chapter B(III).</p>
      <p n="95">7. Genotyping</p>
      <p n="96">7.1. The prion protein genotype shall be determined for each positive TSE case in sheep. TSE cases found in resistant genotypes (sheep of genotypes which encode alanin on both alleles at codon 136, arginin on both alleles at codon 154 and arginin on both alleles at codon 171) shall immediately be reported to the Commission. Where possible, such cases shall be submitted for strain-typing. Where strain-typing of such cases is not possible, the herd of origin and all other herds where the animal has been shall be subjected to enhanced monitoring with a view to find other TSE cases for strain-typing.</p>
      <p n="97">7.2. In addition to the animals genotyped under the provisions of point 7.1, the prion protein genotype of a sample of ovine animals shall be determined. In the case of Member States with an adult sheep population of more than 750000 adult animals, this sample shall consist of at least 600 animals. In the case of other Member States the sample shall consist of at least 100 animals. The samples may be chosen from animals slaughtered for human consumption, from animals dead-on farm or from live animals. The sampling should be representative of the entire ovine population.</p>
