      <p n="2">Directive 2003/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 22 July 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Council Directive 86/609/EEC on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p>

Currently, changes to the Annexes can only be adopted by the long-drawn-out co-decision procedure with the consequence that their content is lagging behind the latest developments in the field.</p>

      <p n="30">Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 16 September 2004. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="31">When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by the Member States.</p>
