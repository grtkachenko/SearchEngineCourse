      <head n="1">Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 on the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding</head>
      <p n="2">Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 4 November 2003</p>
      <p n="4">on the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 191 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="8">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(1),</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Article 191 of the Treaty states that political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union and that they contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) A number of basic rules should be laid down, in the form of regulations, for political parties at European level, in particular with regard to their funding. Experience acquired in applying this Regulation should reveal the extent to which these regulations should, or should not, be supplemented by further rules.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Experience has shown that a political party at European level will have as its members either citizens gathered together in the form of a political party or political parties which together form an alliance. The terms "political party" and "alliance of political parties" used in this Regulation should therefore be clarified.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) In order to be able to identify a "political party at European level", it is important to set certain conditions. In particular, it is necessary for political parties at European level to observe the principles on which the European Union is founded, as set out in the Treaties and recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="14">(5) The procedure to be followed by political parties at European level which wish to receive funding pursuant to this Regulation should be laid down.</p>
      <p n="15">(6) Provision should also be made for regular verification of the conditions applied for identifying a political party at European level.</p>
      <p n="16">(7) Political parties at European level which have received funding under this Regulation should submit to obligations aimed at ensuring transparency of sources of funding.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) In accordance with Declaration No 11 on Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the European Community annexed to the Final Act of the Treaty of Nice, the funding granted pursuant to this Regulation should not be used to fund, either directly or indirectly, political parties at national level. By virtue of same declaration, the provisions on the funding of political parties at European level should apply, on the same basis, to all the political forces represented in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p n="18">(9) The nature of the expenditure that can be funded under this Regulation should be defined.</p>
      <p n="19">(10) The appropriations allocated to funding under this Regulation should be determined in accordance with the annual budgetary procedure.</p>
      <p n="20">(11) It is necessary to ensure maximum transparency and financial control of political parties at European level funded from the general budget of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="21">(12) A scale should be set for distributing the appropriations available each year, taking into account, on the one hand, the number of beneficiaries and, on the other, the number of elected members in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p n="22">(13) Technical assistance to be afforded by the European Parliament to political parties at European level should be guided by the principle of equal treatment.</p>
      <p n="23">(14) The application of this Regulation and the activities funded should be examined in a report from the European Parliament which should be published.</p>
      <p n="24">(15) The judicial control which falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice will help ensure the correct application of this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="25">(16) In order to facilitate transition towards the new rules, the application of some of the provisions of this Regulation should be postponed until the European Parliament has been formed after the elections due in June 2004,</p>
      <p n="26">HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="49">The European Parliament shall adopt a decision within three months and authorise and manage the corresponding appropriations.</p>
      <p n="50">2. The first application shall be accompanied by the following documents:</p>
      <p n="51">(a) documents proving that the applicant satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 3;</p>
      <p n="52">(b) a political programme setting out the objectives of the political party at European level;</p>
      <p n="53">(c) a statute defining in particular the bodies responsible for political and financial management as well as the bodies or natural persons holding, in each of the Member States concerned, the power of legal representation, in particular for the purposes of the acquisition or disposal of movable and immovable property and of being a party to legal proceedings.</p>
      <p n="54">3. Any amendment concerning the documents referred to in paragraph 2, in particular a political programme or statute, which have already been presented, shall be notified to the European Parliament within two months. In the absence of such notification, funding shall be suspended.</p>
      <p n="55">Article 5</p>
      <p n="56">Verification</p>
