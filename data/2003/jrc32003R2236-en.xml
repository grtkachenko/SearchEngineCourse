      <head n="1">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2236/2003 of 23 December 2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch</head>
      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2236/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 23 December 2003</p>
      <p n="4">laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 of 27 July 1994 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch(1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 97/95(2) laid down rules concerning the application of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94. By reason of the amendments of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 by the Treaty of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, and by the Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001, Regulation (EC) No 97/95 should be adapted in order to take into account those amendments. For the sake of clarity and legal certainty, it is therefore necessary to repeal Regulation (EC) No 97/95 and to replace it by a new text.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) In order to benefit from the Community aid under the system of quotas laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1868/94, undertakings producing potato starch should conclude cultivation contracts with potato producers.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) It is necessary to specify what matters should be covered by a cultivation contract between an undertaking producing potato starch and a producer so as to prevent the conclusion of contracts in excess of the undertaking's subquota. Such undertakings should be prohibited from accepting delivery of potatoes not covered by a cultivation contract, as this would put at risk the effectiveness of the quota system and the requirement that the minimum price set out in Article 4a of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 be paid for all potatoes intended for starch production. Nevertheless, it should be possible, where climatic reasons lead to production in the areas covered by the cultivation contract of a larger quantity of potatoes or of potatoes with a higher starch content than was originally foreseen, for an undertaking producing potato starch to accept such potatoes provided that it pays the minimum price.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Potatoes having a starch content of less than 13 % cannot be considered potatoes intended for the manufacture of potato starch. Potatoes with a starch content of less than 13 % should not be accepted by starch-producing undertakings. The Commission should, where climatic reasons lead to a lower starch content, and at the request of a Member State, be able to authorise the acceptance of potatoes having a starch content lower than 13 % under certain conditions.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) It is necessary to define acceptable methods for determining the underwater weight of potatoes and to provide a table showing the corresponding starch content and aid payable.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) Inspection measures should be introduced to ensure that only starch produced in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation gives rise to payment of the premium. In order to protect producers of potatoes intended for the production of starch, it is essential for the minimum price set out in Article 4(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 to be paid for all potatoes. It is therefore necessary to provide for sanctions where the minimum price has not been paid, or where starch-producing undertakings have accepted potatoes not covered by a cultivation contract.</p>
      <p n="15">(7) Rules are necessary to ensure that potato starch produced in excess of a starch-producing undertaking's subquota is exported without export refund, as is required by Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94. Sanctions should be applied in the event of any breach.</p>
      <p n="16">(8) It is necessary to specify what will happen to the subquota of starch-producing undertakings which merge, change ownership or cease trading.</p>
      <p n="17">(9) It is necessary to enable the Member States and the Commission to control the operation of the quota system. The information to be communicated by undertakings producing potato starch to the Member State, and by the Member State to the Commission, should be specified.</p>
      <p n="18">(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,</p>
      <p n="19">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="20">CHAPTER I DEFINITIONS - QUOTA SYSTEM</p>

Each starch-producing undertaking shall forward to the competent authority before the beginning of the marketing year a summary of the contracts, including for each contract, the identification number, the name of the producer, the areas cultivated, and the tonnage contracted, expressed in terms of starch equivalent, before a date to be fixed by the Member State before the beginning of the marketing year, in order to ensure the necessary controls.</p>
      <p n="47">3. The total in starch equivalent of the quantities listed in the cultivation contracts shall not exceed the subquota established for that starch-producing undertaking.</p>
      <p n="48">4. Where the quantity actually produced under the cultivation contract in starch equivalent exceeds the quantity stated in the contract, that quantity may be delivered, if the starch-producing undertaking so chooses, provided the minimum price referred to in Article 4a of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 is paid for it.</p>
      <p n="49">5. A starch-producing undertaking may not take delivery of potatoes not covered by a cultivation contract.</p>
      <p n="50">Article 4</p>
      <p n="51">1. Delivery of potatoes shall take place either at the starch-producing undertakings themselves or at their delivery points.</p>
      <p n="52">2. The determination the weight of the potatoes and the starch content, in conformity with Articles 5 and 7, shall be carried out at the time of delivery and under the authority of an inspector approved by the Member State.</p>
      <p n="53">Article 5</p>
      <p n="54">1. Where so required for the purposes of one of the methods referred to in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 2235/2003(4), the gross weight of the potatoes shall be determined for each load at the time of delivery by comparative weighing of the means of transport used, loaded and empty.</p>

      <p n="57">However, starch-producing undertakings may accept consignments of potatoes with a starch content below 13 %, provided that the quantity of starch that can be manufactured from these potatoes does not exceed 1 % of the subquota. The minimum price to be paid in this case shall be that valid for a starch content of 13 %.</p>
      <p n="58">Article 6</p>

No premium shall be granted for starch produced from potatoes that are not of sound and fair marketable quality nor for starch produced from potatoes whose starch content is below 13 %, except where the second subparagraph of Article 5(3) applies.</p>
      <p n="63">Where the starch content of the potatoes is calculated by Reimann's or Parrow's scale and corresponds to a figure appearing on two or three lines in the second column in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 2235/2003, the rates applicable shall be those for the second or third line.</p>
      <p n="64">2. Where the batches delivered contain 25 % or more of potatoes which can pass through a screen with a square mesh of 28 mm (hereinafter described as "tailings"), the net weight used for determining the minimum price to be paid by the starch manufacturer shall be reduced as follows:</p>
      <p n="65">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="66">If the batches contain more than 50 % of tailings, they shall be dealt with by mutual agreement and no premium shall be paid thereon.</p>
      <p n="67">The percentage of tailings shall be determined at the same time as the net weight.</p>
      <p n="68">3. Observance of the limits of the subquota by the starch-producing undertakings shall be determined on the basis of the quantity and starch content of the potatoes used, in accordance with the rates laid down in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 2235/2003.</p>

      <p n="105">1. The Member States shall introduce inspection arrangements for on-the-spot verification of the operations conferring entitlement to the premium and compliance with the subquota laid down for each starch-producing undertaking. In order to carry out such checks, inspectors shall have access to the stock records and accounts of undertakings and to manufacturing and storage premises.</p>
      <p n="106">During each processing period, inspection shall cover the entire processing of at least 10 % of the potatoes supplied to the starch-producing undertaking.</p>
      <p n="107">2. Member States shall inform each starch-producing undertaking, as appropriate, of the amounts of starch by which it has exceeded its subquota.</p>
      <p n="108">3.
