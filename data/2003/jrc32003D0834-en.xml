      <p n="58">The Team will be headed by a Team leader appointed by the SG/HR after consultations with the Council and the Commission from candidates proposed by Member States, acceding States and the EU institutions. These candidates should have sound experience and expertise in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments, as well as a good knowledge of the functioning of the EU, in particular the CFSP and ESDP.</p>
