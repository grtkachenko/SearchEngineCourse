      <p n="2">Commission Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 14 February 2003</p>
      <p n="4">establishing revised ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to laundry detergents and amending Decision 1999/476/EC</p>
      <p n="5">(notified under document number C(2003) 143)</p>
      <p n="6">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="7">(2003/200/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 the Community eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria are to be established according to product groups.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) It also provides that the review of the eco-label criteria, as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to the criteria, is to take place in due time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for each product group.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) It is appropriate to revise the ecological criteria that were established by Commission Decision 1999/476/EC of 10 June 1999 establishing ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to laundry detergents(2) in order to reflect the developments in the market. At the same time, the period of validity of that Decision as extended by Decision 2002/172/EC(3) and the definition of the product group should be modified.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) A new Decision should be adopted establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of five years.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than 18 months, both the new criteria and the criteria established by Decision 1999/476/EC should be valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies that have been awarded or that have applied for the award of the eco-label for their products prior to the date of application of this Decision to adapt those products to comply with the new criteria.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are based on the draft criteria developed by the European Union Eco-labelling Board established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,</p>
      <p n="20">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="21">Article 1</p>
      <p n="22">In order to be awarded the Community eco-label under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, a laundry detergent must fall within the product group "laundry detergents" as defined in Article 2, and must comply with the ecological criteria set out in the Annex to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 2</p>
      <p n="24">The product group "laundry detergents" shall comprise all laundry detergents, in powder, liquid or any other form, for the washing of textiles, and which are intended to be used principally in household machines, but not excluding the use in launderettes and common laundries.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 3</p>
      <p n="26">For administrative purposes the product group code number assigned to this product group shall be "6".</p>
      <p n="27">Article 4</p>
      <p n="28">Article 3 of Decision 1999/476/EC is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="29">"Article 3</p>
      <p n="30">The product group definition and the specific ecological criteria for the product group shall be valid until 31 August 2004."</p>
      <p n="31">Article 5</p>
      <p n="32">This Decision shall apply from 1 March 2003 until 29 February 2008.</p>
      <p n="33">Producers of products falling within the product group "laundry detergents" which have already been awarded the eco-label before 1 March 2003 may continue to use that label until 31 August 2004.</p>
      <p n="34">Producers of products falling within the product group "laundry detergents" which have already applied for the award of the eco-label before 1 March 2003 may be awarded the eco-label under the terms of Decision 1999/476/EC. In these cases the label may be used until 31 August 2004.</p>
      <p n="35">Article 6</p>
      <p n="36">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="37">Done at Brussels, 14 February 2003.</p>
      <p n="38">For the Commission</p>
      <p n="39">Margot Wallstr√∂m</p>
      <p n="40">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="41">(1) OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="42">(2) OJ L 187, 20.7.1999, p. 52.</p>
      <p n="43">(3) OJ L 56, 27.2.2002, p. 32.</p>
      <p n="44">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="45">FRAMEWORK</p>
      <p n="46">The aims of the criteria</p>
      <p n="47">These criteria aim in particular at promoting:</p>
      <p n="48">- savings of transport and energy by favouring compact laundry detergents,</p>
      <p n="49">- reduction of water pollution by reducing the volume of total chemicals used in the products and by limiting the use of potentially hazardous ingredients,</p>
      <p n="50">- the minimisation of waste production by reducing the amount of primary packaging.</p>
      <p n="51">Additionally, the criteria enhance the consumers' environmental awareness. The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of laundry detergents that have a low environmental impact.</p>
      <p n="52">Assessment and verification requirements</p>
      <p n="53">The specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion.</p>
      <p n="54">Where the applicant is required to provide declarations, documentation, analyses test reports, or other evidence to show compliance with the criteria, it is understood that these may originate from the applicant and/or his supplier(s) and/or their supplier(s), et cetera, as appropriate.</p>
      <p n="55">Where possible, the testing should be performed by laboratories that meet the general requirements of EN ISO 17025 or equivalent.</p>
      <p n="56">Where appropriate, test methods other than those indicated for each criterion may be used if the Competent Body assessing the application accepts their equivalence.</p>
      <p n="57">The concentration of ingredients in the product, which implies a requirement for documentation of compliance with the ecological criteria, is generally defined at &gt;= 0,1 % by weight of the preparation. This concentration is defined at &gt;= 0,01 % by weight of the preparation for the criterion on dangerous, hazardous or toxic substances or preparations.</p>
      <p n="58">Appendix IA. presents the detergent ingredient database (DID list) which contains the most widely used ingredients used in detergent formulations. It shall be used for deriving the data for the calculations of CDVtox and for the assessment of the biodegradability of surfactants.</p>
      <p n="59">Where appropriate, the applicant may use subsequent revisions of the detergent ingredient database as they become available.</p>
      <p n="60">For ingredients which are not included in the DID list, the applicant shall, under his own responsibility, find the appropriate values for the relevant parameters by using the approach described in Appendix IB.</p>
      <p n="61">For ingredients, which are not listed in the DID list, the applicant may use an approach to provide the necessary documentation of anaerobic degradability described in Appendix IC.</p>
      <p n="62">Where appropriate, Competent Bodies may require supporting documentation and may carry out independent verifications.</p>
      <p n="63">The Competent Bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria (note: it is not required to implement such management schemes).</p>
      <p n="64">Functional unit and reference dosage</p>
      <p n="65">The functional unit is expressed in g/wash (grams per wash). For heavy-duty detergents this is related to the dosage per 4,5 kg load (dry textiles) and for low-duty detergents to the dosage per 2,5 kg load (dry textiles) in the washing machine. The dosage recommended by the manufacturer to consumers for the water hardness of 2,5 mmol CaCO3/l and "normally soiled" textiles is taken as the reference dosage for the calculation of the ecological criteria, and the test of washing performance. If the water hardness of 2,5 mmol CaCO3/l is not relevant in the Member States in which the detergent is marketed, the applicant shall specify the dosage used as the reference.</p>
      <p n="66">CRITERIA</p>
      <p n="67">1. Total chemicals</p>
      <p n="68">Total chemicals are the recommended dosage in g/wash minus the water content.</p>
      <p n="69">The amount of total chemicals shall not exceed 100 g/wash.</p>
      <p n="70">Assessment and verification:</p>
      <p n="71">the exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the Competent Body, together with the details of the calculations showing compliance with this criterion.</p>
      <p n="72">2. Insoluble inorganic ingredients</p>
      <p n="73">The total amount of insoluble inorganic ingredients at the recommended dosage shall be less than 30 g/wash.</p>
      <p n="74">Assessment and verification:</p>
      <p n="75">the exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the Competent Body, together with the details of the calculations showing compliance with this criterion.</p>
      <p n="76">3. Toxicity to aquatic organisms</p>
      <p n="77">The critical dilution volume toxicity (CDVtox) is calculated for each ingredient (i) using the following equation:</p>
      <p n="78">&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p>
      <p n="79">where weight (i) is the weight of the ingredient per recommended dose, LF is the loading factor and LTE is the long-term toxicity effect concentration of the ingredient.</p>
      <p n="80">The values of the LF and LTE parameters shall be as given in the detergent ingredient database list (DID list) in Appendix 1A. If the ingredient in question is not included in the DID list, the applicant shall estimate their values following the approach described in Appendix 1B. The CDVtox is summed for each ingredient, making the CDVtox for the product:</p>
      <p n="81">CDVtox= Œ£ CDVtox(ingredient)</p>
      <p n="82">The CDVtox of the recommended dosage shall not exceed 4500 l/wash.</p>
      <p n="83">Assessment and verification:</p>
      <p n="84">the exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the Competent Body, together with the details of the CDVtox calculations showing compliance with this criterion.</p>
      <p n="85">4. Phosphates</p>
      <p n="86">The total amount of phosphates (as sodium tripolyphosphate-STPP) at the recommended dosage shall not exceed 25 g/wash.</p>
      <p n="87">Assessment and verification:</p>
      <p n="88">the exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the Competent Body, together with the details of the calculations showing compliance with this criterion.</p>
      <p n="89">5. Biodegradability of surfactants</p>

      <p n="91">Each surfactant used in the product shall be readily biodegradable.</p>
      <p n="92">Assessment and verification:</p>
      <p n="93">the exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the Competent Body. The DID list (see Appendix IA) indicates whether a specific surfactant is aerobically biodegradable or not (i.e. those that have an entry of "Y" in the column on aerobic non-biodegradability shall not be used). For surfactants which are not included in the DID list, the relevant information from literature or other sources, or appropriate test results, showing that they are aerobically biodegradable shall be provided. The tests for ready biodegradability shall be as referred to in Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances(1), and its subsequent amendments, in particular the methods detailed in Annex V.C4, or their equivalent OECD 301 A-F test methods, or their equivalent ISO tests. The 10 days window principle shall not apply. The pass levels shall be 70 % for the tests referred to in Annex V.C4(A) and C4(B) of Directive 67/548/EEC (and their equivalent OECD 301 A and E tests and ISO equivalents), and shall be 60 % for tests C4-C, D, E and F (and their equivalent OECD 301 B, C, D and F tests and ISO equivalents).</p>
      <p n="94">(b) Anaerobic biodegradability</p>

      <p n="96">Assessment and verification:</p>
      <p n="97">the exact formulation of the product shall be provided. The DID list (see Appendix IA) indicates whether a specific surfactant is anaerobically biodegradable or not (i.e. those that have an entry of "Y" in the column on anaerobic biodegradability shall not be used). For surfactants which are not included in the DID list, the relevant information from literature or other sources, or appropriate test results, showing that they are anaerobically biodegradable shall be provided. The reference test for anaerobic degradability shall be ISO 11734, ECETOC No 28 (June 1988) or an equivalent test method, with the requirement of 60 % ultimate degradability under anaerobic conditions. Test methods simulating the conditions in a relevant anaerobic environment may also be used to document that 60 % ultimate degradability has been attained under anaerobic conditions (see Appendix IC).</p>

      <p n="213">Aquatic toxicity</p>
      <p n="214">The lowest validated long-term effect (LTE) data on fish, daphnia magna or algae should be considered for the calculation of the critical dilution volume criterion (toxicity).</p>
      <p n="215">In cases where data on homologues and/or QSARs (quantitative structure activity relationships) are used, a correction could be considered for the finally selected LTE data.</p>
      <p n="216">In the absence of LTE data the following procedure has to be applied in order to estimate the LTE data by using the specified uncertainty factor (UF) on the data of the most sensitive species:</p>

      <p n="218">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="219">Deviation from this rule may be admitted if evidence can be provided that lower factors or data can be scientifically justified. NOEC is the no observed effect concentration (in a chronic toxicity test).</p>
      <p n="220">Surfactants</p>
      <p n="221">&gt;TABLE&gt;</p>
      <p n="222">In the last case referred to above, an uncertainty factor of 20 may be used instead of 50 only if 1-2 L(E)C50 (LC50 in case of fish toxicity, EC50 in case of daphnia or algal toxicity) data are available and if it can be concluded from the information for other compounds that the most sensitive species have been tested. Such a rule can be applied only within a group of homologues. It should be emphasised that the LTEs (long-term effects) used must be consistent within a group of homologues with respect to the influence of, for example, length of alkyl chain for LAS (linear alkylbenzene sulphonate) or number of EOs (ethoxy groups) for alcohol-ethoxylate if such QSARs can be established.</p>
      <p n="223">Any deviation from the described scheme has to be well reasoned for the specific chemical.</p>

      <p n="233">(3) The correction factors are to be established on the basis of the ingredient properties and applied to the dosage expressed in g/wash.</p>
      <p n="234">Appendix I.C</p>
      <p n="235">Documentation of anaerobic biodegradability</p>
      <p n="236">The following approach may be used to provide the necessary documentation of anaerobic degradability in the case of ingredients that are not listed in the DID list.</p>
      <p n="237">1. Apply reasonable extrapolation. Use test results obtained with one raw material to extrapolate the ultimate anaerobic degradability of structurally related surfactants. If anaerobic biodegradability has been confirmed for a surfactant (or a group of homologues) according to the DID list, it can be assumed that a similar type of surfactant is also anaerobically biodegradable (for example, C12-15 A 1-3 EO sulphate (DID No 8) is anaerobically biodegradable, and a similar anaerobic biodegradability may also be assumed for C12-15 A 6 EO sulphate). If anaerobic biodegradability has been confirmed for a surfactant by use of an appropriate test method, it can be assumed that a similar type of surfactant is also anaerobically biodegradable (for example, literature data confirming the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactants belonging to the group alkyl ester ammonium salts may be used as documentation for a similar anaerobic biodegradability of other quaternary ammonium salts containing ester-linkages in the alkyl chain(s)).</p>
      <p n="238">2. Perform screening test for anaerobic degradability. If new testing is necessary, perform a screening test by use of ISO 11734, ECETOC No 28 (June 1988) or an equivalent method.</p>
      <p n="239">3. Perform low-dosage degradability test. If new testing is necessary, and in the case of experimental problems in the screening test (for example, inhibition due to toxicity of test substance), repeat testing by using a low dosage of surfactant and monitor degradation by 14C measurements or chemical analyses. Testing at low dosages may be performed by use of OECD 308 (August 2000) or an equivalent method.</p>
