      <p n="2">Commission Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 14 November 2003</p>
      <p n="4">laying down the animal health conditions and certification requirements for imports of molluscs, their eggs and gametes for further growth, fattening, relaying or human consumption</p>
      <p n="5">(notified under document number C(2003) 4153)</p>
      <p n="6">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="7">(2003/804/EC)</p>
      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2), and in particular Article 19(1), Article 20(1) and Article 21(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) A list of third countries or parts thereof, from which Member States are authorised to import live molluscs, their eggs and gametes for further growth, fattening, relaying or human consumption in the Community, should be established.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) It is necessary to lay down specific animal health conditions and model certificates for those third countries, taking into account the animal health situation of the third country concerned and of the molluscs, eggs or gametes to be imported, in order to prevent the introduction of disease agents that could cause significant impact to the mollusc stock in the Community.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Attention should be paid to emerging diseases and diseases which are exotic to the Community and which could have a serious impact on the mollusc stock in the Community. Furthermore, the disease situation as regards the mollusc diseases referred to in Annex D to Council Directive 95/70/EC of 22 December 1995 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain diseases affecting bivalve molluscs(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003, and in list II, column 1, of Annex A to Directive 91/67/EEC, at the place of production and where appropriate at the place of destination should be taken into account.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) It is necessary that the countries or parts thereof from which Member States are authorised to import molluscs, their eggs and gametes for further growth or fattening, relaying or human consumption, apply conditions for disease control and monitoring at least equivalent to Community standards as laid down in Directives 91/67/EEC and 95/70/EC. The sampling and testing methods used should be at least equivalent to Commission Decision 2002/878/EC(4). In cases where sampling and testing methods are not laid down in the Community legislation, the sampling and testing methods used should be in accordance with those laid down in the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) Manual of diagnostic tests for aquatic animals.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) It is necessary that the responsible competent authorities of these third countries undertake to notify, by fax, telegram or electronic mail, the Commission and the Member States within 24 hours of any occurrence of diseases referred to in Annex D to Directive 95/70/EC, and list II, column 1 of Annex A to Directive 91/67/EEC, as well as any other disease outbreaks causing a significant abnormal mortality in molluscs within their territory or parts thereof from which imports covered by this Decision are authorised. In such event, the responsible competent authorities of those third countries must take measures to prevent the disease spreading into the Community.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) Taking into account the international practical and scientific experiences gained, the animal health provisions laid down by Commission Decision 95/352/EC of 25 July 1995 laying down the animal health conditions and the certification requirements for the importation from third countries of Crassostrea gigas for relaying in Community waters(5) needs to be updated and amended as appropriate. For the sake of clarity, those provisions should be included in this Decision and Decision 95/352/EC should be repealed.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) Therefore, it is necessary to supplement the public health certification requirements relating to the importation of live molluscs and unprocessed products thereof, in Council Directive 91/492/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and placing of the market of live bivalve molluscs(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003, with the animal health certification requirements for import of live molluscs.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) This Decision should apply without prejudice to the public health conditions established under Directive 91/492/EEC and Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products(7), as last amended by Decision 806/2003/EC.</p>
      <p n="20">(9) The risk of introducing diseases that can cause significant impact on molluscs within the community by imports of non-viable molluscs is considered low. The requirements laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC, in particular Articles 11 of that Directive, gives the appropriate level of protection as regards non-viable molluscs, and therefore additional animal health certification for non-viable molluscs is not necessary.</p>
      <p n="21">(10) Council Directive 96/93/EC of 17 December 1996 on the certification of animals and animal products(8) lays down standards of certification. The rules and principles applied by third country certifying officers in accordance with this Decision should provide guarantees which are equivalent to those laid down in that Directive.</p>
      <p n="22">(11) The principles laid down in Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption(9), in particular Article 3 of that Directive should be taken into account.</p>
      <p n="23">(12) It would reduce the possibility to control and eradicate diseases which are exotic to the Community and which could have serious impact on the mollusc stocks in the Community, if molluscs that could carry the disease are released into free waters in the Community. Live molluscs, eggs and gametes, should therefore be imported into the Community only if they are introduced into a farm registered by the competent authority in the Member State in accordance with Article 3(1) of Directive 95/70/EC.</p>
      <p n="24">(13) This Decision should not apply to the importation of ornamental molluscs kept permanently in aquariums.</p>
      <p n="25">(14) A transitional period of time should be provided for the implementation of these new import certification requirements.</p>
      <p n="26">(15) Annex I to this Decision should be reviewed before the date of application.</p>
      <p n="27">(16) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>

      <p n="110">ANNEX III</p>
      <p n="111">Explanatory notes for certification and labelling</p>
      <p n="112">(a) The certificates shall be produced by the competent authorities of the exporting country, based on the appropriate model appearing in Annex II to this Decision taking into account the use to which the molluscs are to be put after the arrival to the EC.</p>
      <p n="113">(b) Considering the status of the place of destination as regards Bonamia ostreae and Marteilia refringens in the EC Member State, the appropriate specific additional requirements shall be incorporated and completed in the certificate.</p>
      <p n="114">(c) The original of each certificate shall consist of a single page, double-sided, or, where more than one page is required, it shall be in such a form that all pages form part of an integrated whole and are indivisible.</p>
      <p n="115">It shall, on the right-hand side of the top of each page, be marked as "original" and bear a specific code number issued by the competent authority. All pages of the certificate shall be numbered - (page number) of (total number of pages).</p>
      <p n="116">(d) The original of the certificate and the labels referred to in the model certificate shall be drawn up in at least one official language of the EC Member State in which the inspection at the border post shall be carried out and of the EC Member State of destination. However, these Member States may allow other languages, if necessary, accompanied by an official translation.</p>
      <p n="117">(e) The original of the certificate must be completed on the day of loading the consignment for exportation to the European Community with an official stamp and signed by an official inspector designated by the competent authority. In doing so, the competent authority of the exporting country shall ensure that the principles of certification equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 96/93/EC are followed.</p>
      <p n="118">The stamp, unless embossed, and the signature shall be in a colour different to that of the printing.</p>
      <p n="119">(f) If for reasons of identification of the items of the consignment, additional pages are attached to the certificate, these pages shall be considered as forming part of the original and be signed and stamped by the certifying official inspector on each page.</p>
      <p n="120">(g) The original of the certificate must accompany the consignment until it reaches the EC border inspection post.</p>
      <p n="121">(h) The certificate shall be valid for 10 days from the date of issue. In the case of transport by ship, the time of validity is prolonged by the time of the journey at sea.</p>
      <p n="122">(i) The molluscs, their eggs and gametes, shall not be transported together with other molluscs, eggs or gametes that, either are not destined to the European Community, or are of a lower health status. Furthermore, they must not be transported under any other conditions that alter their health status.</p>
      <p n="123">(j) The possible presence of pathogens in the water is a relevant factor when considering the health status of molluscs. The certifying officer should therefore consider the following:</p>
      <p n="124">the "place of origin" should be the localisation of the farm or harvested natural bed where the molluscs were reared reaching their commercial size relevant for the consignment covered by this certificate.</p>
      <p n="125">The "place of harvest" should be the last place the molluscs were in contact with natural waters in the exporting country, like purification centres or intermediate storage places where molluscs are kept before exported to the Community.</p>
      <p n="126">ANNEX IV</p>
      <p n="127">Statements as regard live molluscs, their eggs and gametes intended for further growth, fattening, relaying or human consumption in the European Community to be issued by the competent authority at the border inspection post to complete the document referred to in the Annex to Decision 92/527/EEC</p>
      <p n="128">The competent authority at the border inspection post in the Member State of arrival shall complete the document referred to in the Annex to Decision 92/527/EEC with one of the following statements as appropriate:</p>
