      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 357/79 of 5 February 1979 on statistical surveys of areas under vines(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2329/98(2), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,</p>

      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 991/79 of 17 May 1979 setting out a schedule of tables and laying down the definitions relating to basic statistical surveys of areas under vines and repealing Regulations No 143 and No 26/64/EEC(5) has been substantially amended(6). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 357/79, the Member States are to submit the results of the basic surveys in the form of a schedule of tables to be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of the said Regulation.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) In order to ensure the comparability of data shown in these tables, it is necessary to provide for certain definitions relating to the basic surveys.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics and the Management Committee for Wine,</p>
      <p n="14">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="15">Article 1</p>
      <p n="16">The form of the schedule of tables for the basic surveys of the areas under vines shall be as set out in Annex I.</p>
      <p n="17">Article 2</p>
      <p n="18">1. The definitions relating to the basic surveys are given in Annex II.</p>
      <p n="19">2. Given that the basic statistical surveys cover the situation at the end of the wine-growing year, the area under vines planted, replanted or grafted during the wine-growing year preceding the survey shall be considered to be under one year old.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 3</p>
      <p n="21">Regulation (EEC) No 991/79 is repealed.</p>
      <p n="22">References to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table set out in Annex IV.</p>
      <p n="23">Article 4</p>
      <p n="24">This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="25">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
