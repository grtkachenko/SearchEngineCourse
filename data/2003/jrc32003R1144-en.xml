      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1144/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 27 June 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulations (EC) Nos 1279/98, 1128/1999 and 1247/1999 as regards certain tariff quotas for certain live bovine animals and beef and veal products originating in the Slovak Republic, Republic of Bulgaria and Republic of Poland</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2), and in particular Article 32(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Council Decision 2003/299/EC of 14 April 2003 concerning the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Slovak Republic, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the Parties on new mutual agricultural concessions(3) provides for new concessions as regards the importation of certain live animals and beef and veal products under the tariff quotas opened by that Agreement, applicable from 1 May 2003.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Council Decision 2003/286/EC of 8 April 2003 concerning the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Bulgaria, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the Parties on new mutual agricultural concessions(4) provides for new concessions as regards the importation of certain live animals and beef and veal products under the tariff quotas opened by that Agreement, applicable from 1 June 2003.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1279/98 of 19 June 1998 laying down detailed rules for applying the tariff quotas for beef and veal provided for in Council Regulations (EC) No 2290/2000, (EC) No 2433/2000, (EC) No 2434/2000 and (EC) No 1408/2002 and Council Decisions 2003/18/EC and 2003/263/EC for Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Poland(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 673/2003(6), Commission Regulation (EC) No 1128/1999 of 28 May 1999 laying down detailed rules of application for a tariff quota for calves weighing not more than 80 kilograms originating in certain third countries(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 673/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1247/1999 of 16 June 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of a tariff quota for live bovine animals weighing from 80 to 300 kilograms and originating in certain third countries(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 673/2003, should therefore be amended.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Council Decisions 2003/298/EC of 14 April 2003 on the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Czech Republic, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the parties on new mutual agricultural concessions(9) and Council Decision 2003/285/EC Council Decision of 18 March 2003 concerning the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Hungary, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the parties on new mutual agricultural concessions(10) repealed respectively Council Regulation (EC) No 2433/2000 of 17 October 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with the Czech Republic(11) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1408/2002 of 29 July 2002 establishing concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Hungary(12). The references made to those Regulations in Regulation (EC) No 1279/98 should, therefore, be replaced.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) Regulation (EC) No 1279/1998 provided for quarterly applications for import licences in order to ensure that quantities laid down are imported in an orderly fashion; while still meeting that objective experience has shown a need to allow for half-yearly applications, with the period of validity of the import licences being extended accordingly. The Regulation should be amended accordingly with effect from 1 July 2003.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) Decision 2003/299/EC and Decision 2003/286/EC provides for new concessions as of 1 May 2003 and 1 June 2003 respectively. Therefore, provisions should be made for the retrospective applicability of these concessions.</p>
