      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1966/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 7 November 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 834/95 concerning the classification of certain goods in the Combined Nomenclature</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1789/2003(2), and in particular Article 9(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 834/95 of 12 April 1995 concerning the classification of certain goods in the combined nomenclature(3) lays down measures concerning the classification in the Combined Nomenclature of a knitted made-up article.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) In its judgment in joined cases C-260/00 to C-263/00(4) in respect of the classification of knee supports and other bandages, the Court of Justice of the European Communities specified criteria to draw a distinction between ordinary versions of bandages that serve a general purpose and versions that are designed to perform a specific medical function and subsequently are to be classified in heading 9021 of the Combined Nomenclature.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) In order to ensure uniform application of the Combined Nomenclature annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, it is necessary to specify the reasons for the classification of the good mentioned in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 834/95, in order to clarify why the classified product is an ordinary version of a knee-bandage.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,</p>
      <p n="13">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="14">Article 1</p>
      <p n="15">In Column 3 (reasons) of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 834/95 the following paragraph is added.</p>
      <p n="16">"Classification of the article in heading 9021 as orthopaedic appliance is excluded, because the hinges are not adjustable to a specific handicap of a patient. Moreover, the article does not show a high degree of precision.</p>
      <p n="17">Therefore, the article is an ordinary support for general use and it does not serve a specific medical purpose.</p>
      <p n="18">The adjustment of the article around the leg by two 'velcro-type' strips, does not serve any specific medical purpose, because the 'velcro-type' strips merely hold the knee-pad in place."</p>
      <p n="19">Article 2</p>
      <p n="20">This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="21">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="22">Done at Brussels, 7 November 2003.</p>
      <p n="23">For the Commission</p>

      <p n="25">Member of the Commission</p>
      <p n="26">(1) OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="27">(2) OJ L 281, 30.10.2003, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="28">(3) OJ L 84, 14.4.1995, p. 1.</p>
      <p n="29">(4) Judgment of the Court of Justice of 7 November 2002 in joined cases C-260/00 - C-263/00, Lohmann GmbH &amp; Co. KG and Medi Bayreuth Weiherm√ºller &amp; Voigtmann GmbH &amp; Co. KG v. Oberfinanzdirektion Koblenz (not yet published in the ECR).</p>
