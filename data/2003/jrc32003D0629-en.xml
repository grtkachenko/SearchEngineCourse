      <p n="12">(1) Commission Decision 2000/367/EC of 3 May 2000 implementing Council Directive 89/106/EEC as regards the classification of the resistance-to-fire performance of construction products, construction works and parts thereof(3) should, for the purposes of its adaptation to technical progress, also cover smoke and heat control products.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Decision 2000/367/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,</p>

An I classification shall be generated for those cases where the test specimen is a pipe or duct configuration with no assessment of the closure for the conveyor system. The addition of the symbol 'C' indicates that the product also satisfies the 'self-closing' criterion (pass/fail test) (*).";</p>
