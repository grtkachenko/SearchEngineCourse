      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1461/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 18 August 2003</p>
      <p n="4">laying down conditions for pilot projects for the electronic transmission of information on fishing activities and for remote sensing</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy(1), and in particular Article 22(3) and Article 23(5) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to decide in 2004 on the obligations to transmit electronically the information on fishing activities in order to improve the efficiency on management of fishing opportunities and to set up a means of remote sensing in order to detect fishing vessels at sea.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Pilot projects relating respectively to the electronic transmission of information on fishing activities and to the remote sensing, can be carried out, in cooperation with the Commission, in order to assess the technology to be used, before 1 June 2004.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) It is therefore necessary, in order to ensure that Member States carry out these pilot projects, to lay down the conditions of application. In particular those conditions should cover, as regards the electronic transmission of information, the information to be recorded and reported by electronic means, and the functions of the systems on board the fishing vessels which record and transmit electronically the information concerned. As regards remote sensing, the conditions should also cover the functions of this system and the areas to be monitored during the pilot projects.</p>
      <p n="12">(4) The Commission needs to be informed by the Member States of the progress and the results of the pilot projects, in particular in order to assess the cost-effectiveness of the technologies to be used for improving the effectiveness of fisheries control.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) A financial contribution by the Community may be granted in respect of the pilot projects carried out by the Member States, under the conditions set out in Council Decision 2001/431/EC of 28 May 2001 on a financial contribution by the Community to certain expenditure incurred by the Member States in implementing the control, inspection and surveillance systems applicable to the common fisheries policy(2).</p>
      <p n="14">(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee of Fisheries and Aquaculture,</p>
      <p n="15">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="28">Article 4</p>
      <p n="29">Reports to competent authority</p>
      <p n="30">Without prejudice of the obligations laid down in Community law, the master of Community fishing vessels participating in the pilot project shall record daily and report by electronic means to the competent authority of the flag Member State information on the trips and the fishing activities, indicating in particular:</p>
      <p n="31">(a) the quantities of each species caught and kept on board, where they exceed 50 kg of live-weight equivalent;</p>
      <p n="32">(b) the date and location of such catches;</p>
      <p n="33">(c) the type of gear used; and</p>
      <p n="34">(d) for the fishing vessels exceeding 18 metres in length overall and carrying out fishing activities in any areas where specific rules on access to waters and resources apply, the date and time of setting or re-setting of a static gear as well as the date and time of the completion of fishing operations using the static gear.</p>
      <p n="35">Article 5</p>
      <p n="36">Vessel equipment</p>
      <p n="37">Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the vessels flying their flag and participating in the pilot project are equipped with systems capable of recording and transmitting electronically the information on their fishing activities during the pilot projects.</p>
      <p n="38">Article 6</p>
      <p n="39">Transmission of information</p>
      <p n="40">1. No later than one month before the projects become operational, Member States shall forward to the Commission:</p>
      <p n="41">(a) the complete reference of the competent authority designated to follow up the pilot projects;</p>
