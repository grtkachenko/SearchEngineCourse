      <p n="2">Commission Decision</p>
      <p n="3">of 28 January 2003</p>
      <p n="4">authorising Member States to provide for temporary derogations from Council Directive 2000/29/EC in respect of potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, originating in certain provinces of Cuba</p>
      <p n="5">(notified under document number C(2003) 338)</p>
      <p n="6">(2003/63/EC)</p>
      <p n="7">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community(1), as last amended by Directive 2002/89/EC(2), and in particular Article 15(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to the request made by the United Kingdom,</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Under Directive 2000/29/EC, potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, originating in Cuba, may in principle not be introduced into the Community. However, that Directive permits derogations from that rule, provided that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) The early growing in Cuba of potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, from seed potatoes supplied by Member States has become an established practice. Part of the early supply of potatoes in the Community has been ensured by imports of such potatoes from Cuba.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Since 1987 by a succession of Decisions, the most recent being Commission Decision 2001/99/EC(3), derogations from certain provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC, in respect of potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, originating in certain provinces of Cuba, have been authorised for limited periods and subject to specific conditions.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The circumstances justifying those derogations are still valid. There is no new information giving cause for revision of the specific conditions.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) The Member States should therefore be authorised to grant derogations, for certain limited periods and subject to specific conditions.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) That authorisation to grant derogations should be terminated if it is established that the specific conditions laid down in this Decision are not sufficient to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms into the Community or have not been complied with.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,</p>
      <p n="19">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
      <p n="20">Article 1</p>
      <p n="21">By derogation from Article 4(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC with regard to the prohibitions referred to in Part A, point 12 of Annex III, Member States may permit the introduction into their territory of potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, originating in Cuba, under the conditions laid down in the Annex to this Decision.</p>
      <p n="22">Article 2</p>
      <p n="23">The Member States of importation shall inform the other Member States and the Commission by means of the notification referred to in point 2(b) of the Annex of any use made of the authorisation provided for in Article 1.</p>
      <p n="24">The Member States of importation shall provide the Commission and the other Member States, before 1 September 2003, 1 September 2004 and 1 September 2005, with the information on the quantities imported pursuant to this Decision and with a detailed technical report of the official examination referred to in point 2(f) of the Annex. Copies of each phytosanitary certificate shall be transmitted to the Commission.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 3</p>
      <p n="26">Article 1 shall apply to potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, that are introduced into the Community, in the periods:</p>
      <p n="27">(i) between 1 February 2003 and 31 May 2003;</p>
      <p n="28">(ii) between 1 January 2004 and 31 May 2004;</p>
      <p n="29">(iii) between 1 January 2005 and 31 May 2005.</p>
      <p n="30">Article 4</p>
      <p n="31">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
      <p n="32">Done at Brussels, 28 January 2003.</p>

      <p n="41">1. Potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, introduced pursuant to Article 1, shall satisfy the following conditions, in addition to the requirements laid down in Annexes I, II and IV to Directive 2000/29/EC:</p>

      <p n="51">(j) be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued in Cuba in accordance with Articles 7 and 13 of Directive 2000/29/EC, on the basis of the examination laid down therein, in particular certifying freedom from the harmful organism mentioned in (b).</p>
      <p n="52">The certificate shall state:</p>
      <p n="53">- under "Additional declaration":</p>

      <p n="58">- under "Disinfestation and/or disinfection treatment", all information related to the possible treatments referred to in (a) second option and/or (h).</p>
      <p n="59">2. (a) The potatoes shall be introduced through points of entry designated for the purpose of the authorisation referred to in Article 1 by the Member State in which they are situated; these points of entry and the name and address of the responsible official body referred to in Directive 2000/29/EC in charge of each point of entry shall be notified sufficiently in advance by the Member State to the Commission and shall be made available on request to other Member States. If the introduction into the Community takes place in a Member State other than the Member State making use of the authorisation referred to in Article 1, the responsible official bodies of the Member State of introduction shall inform and cooperate with the responsible official bodies of the Member States making use of such authorisation to ensure that the provisions of this Decision are complied with;</p>
      <p n="60">(b) prior to introduction into the Community, the importer shall be officially informed of the conditions laid down in paragraphs 1(a) to (j), and 2(a) to (e); the said importer shall notify details of each introduction sufficiently in advance to the responsible official bodies in the Member State of introduction indicating:</p>

      <p n="71">(f) Member States making use of the authorisation referred to in Article 1 shall, where appropriate, in cooperation with the Member State of introduction ensure that at least two samples of 200 tubers shall be drawn from each consignment of 50 tonnes or part thereof, of imported potatoes pursuant to this Decision, for official examination in respect of Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al. and Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus (Spieckermann et Kotthoff) Davis et al., in accordance with the Community established methods for the detection and diagnosis of those harmful organisms. The tubers shall also be officially examined for potato spindle tuber viroid using the return-PAGE method, or c-DNA hybridisation procedure.</p>
      <p n="72">Moreover, the tubers shall be officially examined for the presence of Meloidogyne chitwoodi Golden et al. (all populations) or Meloidogyne fallax Karssen.</p>
      <p n="73">In the case of suspicion of the presence of any of the harmful organisms referred to in the first subparagraph, the lots shall remain separate under official control and may not be marketed or used until it has been established that the presence of those harmful organisms was not detected in those examinations.</p>
