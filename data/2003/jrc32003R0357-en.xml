      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 357/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 27 February 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulations (EC) No 1938/2001, (EC) No 1939/2001 and (EC) No 1940/2001 on the opening of standing invitations to tender for the resale on the Community internal market of rice held by the Spanish, Greek and Italian intervention agencies for use in animal feed</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular Article 8(b) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 1938/2001(3) and (EC) No 1939/2001(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2089/2002(5), and (EC) No 1940/2001(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 207/2003(7), allow rice mills to take part in the tendering procedure provided they comply with the rules laid down by those Regulations and in particular those concerning the processing of paddy rice into wholly milled rice and marking using certain colourants.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) The efficiency of the measure, particularly as regards the processing time and the cost of verification, can be improved by laying down that manufacturers of compound feedingstuffs may take part in the tendering procedure by making the same undertakings as are currently imposed on rice mills.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Regulations (EC) No 1938/2001, (EC) No 1939/2001 and (EC) No 1940/2001 should therefore be amended.</p>

      <p n="20">- to carry out immediately, under the supervision of the competent authorities at a place determined by agreement with them, the treatments described in Annexes II or III, designed to ensure verification of the use made of the rice and the traceability of the products;</p>
      <p n="21">(b) where they are rice mills:</p>
      <p n="22">- to carry out, within two months of the date of the award of the contract, the treatments described in Annex III of rice for which they are declared the successful tenderer,</p>
      <p n="23">- to see to it that this product is incorporated in feed within four months of the date of the award of the contract, save in cases of force majeure;</p>
      <p n="24">(c) to bear the costs of the processing and treatment of the products;</p>
      <p n="25">(d) to keep stock records so that checks may be made that they have respected their undertakings."</p>
