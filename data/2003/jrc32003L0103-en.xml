      <head n="1">Directive 2003/103/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 amending Directive 2001/25/EC on the minimum level of training of seafarers (Text with EEA relevance)</head>
      <p n="2">Directive 2003/103/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 17 November 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Directive 2001/25/EC on the minimum level of training of seafarers</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),</p>
      <p n="10">After consultation of the Committee of the Regions,</p>
      <p n="11">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(2),</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="13">(1) Directive 2001/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the minimum level of training of seafarers(3) defines minimum training, certification and watchkeeping standards for seafarers serving on board Community ships. Those standards are based on the standards agreed in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended (the STCW Convention).</p>
      <p n="14">(2) In order to maintain and develop the level of knowledge and skills in the maritime sector in the EU, it is important to pay appropriate attention to maritime training and the status of seafarers in the EU.</p>
      <p n="15">(3) It is essential to ensure that seafarers holding certificates issued by third countries and serving on board Community ships have a level of competence equivalent to that required by the STCW Convention. Directive 2001/25/EC lays down procedures and common criteria for the recognition by the Member States of certificates issued by third countries.</p>
      <p n="16">(4) Directive 2001/25/EC provides for the reassessment of the procedures and criteria for the recognition of certificates issued by third countries and the approval of maritime training institutes and maritime education and training programmes and courses, in the light of the experience gained in applying the Directive.</p>
      <p n="17">(5) The practical implementation of Directive 2001/25/EC has shown that some adjustments to those procedures and criteria could contribute greatly towards the reliability of the system of recognition, while simplifying the monitoring and reporting obligations imposed on Member States.</p>
      <p n="18">(6) Compliance by third countries that provide training with the provisions of the STCW Convention can be assessed more effectively in a harmonised manner. The Commission should therefore be entrusted with this task on behalf of the whole Community.</p>
      <p n="19">(7) In order to ensure that a country which is recognised continues to comply fully with the requirements of the STCW Convention, the recognition should be reviewed regularly and extended if appropriate. The recognition of a third country not complying with the requirements of the STCW Convention should be withdrawn until deficiencies are redressed.</p>
      <p n="20">(8) Decisions to extend or withdraw recognition can be taken more effectively in a harmonised and centralised manner, at Community level. The Commission should therefore be entrusted with these tasks on behalf of the whole Community.</p>
      <p n="21">(9) The continuous monitoring of the compliance of the recognised third countries can be carried out more effectively in a harmonised and centralised manner.</p>
      <p n="22">(10) One of the tasks assigned to the European Maritime Safety Agency (the Agency) is to assist the Commission in the performance of any task assigned to it by Community legislation applicable to training, certification and watchkeeping of ships' crews.</p>
      <p n="23">(11) The Agency should therefore assist the Commission in the performance of its tasks relating to the granting, extension and withdrawal of recognition of third countries. It should also assist the Commission in the monitoring of third countries' compliance with the requirements of the STCW Convention.</p>
      <p n="24">(12) The STCW Convention specifies language requirements for certificates and endorsements attesting the issue of a certificate. The existing provisions of Directive 2001/25/EC should be brought into line with the relevant requirements of the Convention.</p>
      <p n="25">(13) The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended (the SOLAS Convention) lays down language requirements for bridge-to-shore safety communications. Directive 2001/25/EC should be updated in accordance with the recent amendments to the SOLAS Convention, which entered into force on 1 July 2002.</p>
      <p n="26">(14) It is necessary to provide for procedures for adapting Directive 2001/25/EC to future changes in Community law.</p>
      <p n="27">(15) Directive 2001/25/EC should be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="28">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="29">Article 1</p>
      <p n="30">Directive 2001/25/EC shall be amended as follows:</p>

      <p n="39">(a) A Member State which intends to recognise, by endorsement, appropriate certificates issued by a third country to a master, officer or radio operator, for service on ships flying its flag, shall submit a request for recognition of that third country to the Commission, stating its reasons.</p>
      <p n="40">The Commission, assisted by the European Maritime Safety Agency (the Agency), and with the possible involvement of any Member State concerned, shall collect the information referred to in Annex II and shall carry out an assessment of the training and certification systems in the third country for which the request for recognition was submitted, in order to verify whether the country concerned meets all the requirements of the STCW Convention and whether the appropriate measures have been taken to prevent fraud involving certificates.</p>
      <p n="41">(b) The decision on the recognition of a third country shall be taken by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 23(2), within three months from the date of the request for recognition. If granted, the recognition shall be valid subject to the provisions of Article 18a.</p>
      <p n="42">(c) If no decision is taken on recognition of the third country concerned within the period laid down in subparagraph (b), the Member State submitting the request may decide to recognise the third country unilaterally until a decision is taken in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 23(2).</p>
      <p n="43">(d) A Member State may decide, with respect to ships flying its flag, to endorse certificates issued by the third countries recognised by the Commission, account being taken of the provisions contained in Annex II(4) and (5).</p>
      <p n="44">(e) Recognitions of certificates issued by recognised third countries and published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series, before (...)(4) shall remain valid. These recognitions may be used by all Member States unless the Commission has subsequently withdrawn them pursuant to Article 18a.</p>
      <p n="45">(f) The Commission shall draw up and update a list of the third countries that have been recognised. The list shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C Series."</p>

      <p n="51">4. The Commission, assisted by the Agency, shall reassess the recognition of the third country concerned in order to verify whether that country failed to comply with the requirements of the STCW Convention.</p>
      <p n="52">5.
