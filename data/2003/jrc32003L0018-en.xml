      <p n="2">Directive 2003/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 27 March 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Council Directive 83/477/EEC on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 137(2) thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), drawn up following consultation with social partners and with the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="10">Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,</p>
      <p n="11">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p>
      <p n="12">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="13">(1) In its Conclusions of 7 April 1998 on the protection of workers against the risks from exposure to asbestos(4) the Council invited the Commission to bring forward proposals for amending Directive 83/477/EEC(5), considering in particular the merits of refocusing and adapting protective measures for those who are now most at risk, in particular workers who remove asbestos and workers who accidentally come across asbestos at work in the course of servicing and maintenance activities.</p>
      <p n="14">(2) In those Conclusions, the Commission was also invited to submit proposals to amend Directive 83/477/EEC in the light of the more detailed research on limits for exposure to chrysotile and the methods for measuring airborne asbestos undertaken on the basis of the method adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Similar steps should be taken regarding substitute fibres.</p>
      <p n="15">(3) The Economic and Social Committee, in its opinion on asbestos(6), called on the Commission to take new measures to reduce the risks to workers.</p>
      <p n="16">(4) The ban on the marketing and use of chrysotile asbestos introduced by Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations(7) with effect from 1 January 2005, will contribute to a substantial reduction in asbestos exposure of workers.</p>
      <p n="17">(5) All workers should be protected against the risks associated with exposure to asbestos and the derogations applicable to the sea and air sectors should therefore be removed.</p>
      <p n="18">(6) In order to ensure clarity in the definition of the fibres, they should be redefined either in mineralogical terms or with regard to their Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number.</p>
      <p n="19">(7) Without prejudice to other Community provisions concerning the marketing and use of asbestos, limiting the activities involving exposure to asbestos should play a very important role in preventing the diseases associated with such exposure.</p>
      <p n="20">(8) The notification system for activities involving exposure to asbestos should be adapted to new work situations.</p>
      <p n="21">(9) It is important to eliminate activities which expose workers to asbestos fibres during the extraction of asbestos or the manufacture and processing of asbestos products or the manufacture and processing of products containing intentionally added asbestos fibres, in view of their high and unpredictable level of exposure.</p>
      <p n="22">(10) Taking account of the latest technical expertise, it is necessary to specify more precisely the sampling methodology used to measure the asbestos level in air and the method of counting fibres.</p>
      <p n="23">(11) Even though it has not yet been possible to identify the exposure threshold below which asbestos does not involve a cancer risk, the limit value for occupational exposure to asbestos should be reduced.</p>
      <p n="24">(12) Employers should be required to record, before the start of any asbestos removal project, the presence or presumed presence of asbestos in buildings or installations and communicate this information to others who may be exposed to asbestos as a result of its use, of maintenance or of other activities in or on the building.</p>
      <p n="25">(13) It should be ensured that demolition or asbestos removal work is carried out by undertakings which are familiar with all the precautions to be taken in order to protect workers.</p>
      <p n="26">(14) Special training for workers exposed or likely to be exposed to asbestos should be provided in order significantly to contribute to reducing the risks related to such exposure.</p>
      <p n="27">(15) The content of the exposure register and medical records provided for in Directive 83/477/EEC should be brought into line with the records referred to in Council Directive 90/394/EEC of 28 June 1990 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens at work (Sixth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC)(8).</p>
      <p n="28">(16) The practical recommendations on the clinical surveillance of exposed workers should be updated in the light of the latest medical expertise, with a view to the early detection of pathologies linked to asbestos.</p>
      <p n="29">(17) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely improvement in the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.</p>
      <p n="30">(18) The amendments contained in this Directive constitute a concrete contribution towards creating the social dimension of the internal market.</p>
      <p n="31">(19) These amendments are limited to the minimum in order not to impose an unnecessary burden on the creation and development of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p n="32">(20) Directive 83/477/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="33">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="34">Article 1</p>
      <p n="35">Directive 83/477/EEC is hereby amended as follows:</p>

      <p n="66">"4. Each time a change in working conditions is likely to result in a significant increase in exposure to dust from asbestos or materials containing asbestos, a new notification must be submitted.";</p>
      <p n="67">5. in Article 5 the following paragraph shall be added:"Without prejudice to the application of other Community provisions on marketing and use of asbestos, activities which expose workers to asbestos fibres during the extraction of asbestos or the manufacture and processing of asbestos products or the manufacture and processing of products containing intentionally added asbestos shall be prohibited, with the exception of the treatment and disposal of products resulting from demolition and asbestos removal.";</p>
      <p n="68">6. Article 6 shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="69">"Article 6</p>
      <p n="70">For all activities referred to in Article 3(1), the exposure of workers to dust arising from asbestos or materials containing asbestos at the place of work must be reduced to a minimum and in any case below the limit value laid down in Article 8, in particular through the following measures:</p>
      <p n="71">1. the number of workers exposed or likely to be exposed to dust arising from asbestos or materials containing asbestos must be limited to the lowest possible figure;</p>
      <p n="72">2. work processes must be designed so as not to produce asbestos dust or, if that proves impossible, to avoid the release of asbestos dust into the air;</p>
      <p n="73">3. all premises and equipment involved in the treatment of asbestos must be capable of being regularly and effectively cleaned and maintained;</p>
      <p n="74">4. asbestos or dust-generating asbestos-containing material must be stored and transported in suitable sealed packing;</p>

      <p n="76">7. Article 7 shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="77">"Article 7</p>
      <p n="78">1. Depending on the results of the initial risk assessment, and in order to ensure compliance with the limit value laid down in Article 8, measurement of asbestos fibres in the air at the workplace shall be carried out regularly.</p>
      <p n="79">2. Sampling must be representative of the personal exposure of the worker to dust arising from asbestos or materials containing asbestos.</p>
      <p n="80">3. Sampling shall be carried out after consultation of the workers and/or their representatives in undertakings.</p>
