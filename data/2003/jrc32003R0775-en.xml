      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 775/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 5 May 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 2759/1999 laying down rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period</p>

      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 of 21 June 1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 696/2003(2), and in particular Article 12(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2759/1999(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2251/2002(4), concerns the processing and marketing measure and its paragraph 2 lists certain expenditure that may be eligible. In order to avoid misinterpretation, it should be clearly indicated that the list of expenditure is not exhaustive.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) Financing Agreements referred to in Article 1(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) 2222/2000(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 188/2003(6), applicable between the Community and each applicant country set already out the parameters determining eligible expenditure. It is therefore appropriate to take into account the relevant provisions of those Agreements.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) Regulation (EC) No 2759/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Agricultural Structures and Rural Development Committee,</p>

      <p n="17">1. in Article 3(2) the introductory phrase is replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="18">"Eligible expenditure may include in particular:";</p>
      <p n="19">2. the following Article 8a is inserted:</p>
      <p n="20">"Article 8a</p>
      <p n="21">Financing Agreements</p>
      <p n="22">For each Programme eligible expenditure shall respect the provisions of the Financing Agreement referred to in Article 1(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000(7) applicable between the Community and the applicant country concerned."</p>
      <p n="23">Article 2</p>
      <p n="24">This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="25">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
