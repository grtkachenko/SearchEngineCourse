      <p n="8">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="9">(1) Intervention measures may be taken in respect of pigmeat if, on the representative markets of the Community, the average price for pig carcases is less than 103 % of the basic price and is likely to remain below that level.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Market prices have fallen below that level and, given seasonal and cyclical trends, this situation could persist.</p>
      <p n="11">(3) Intervention measures must be taken. These can be limited to the granting of private storage aid in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 3444/90 of 27 November 1990 laying down detailed rules for granting private storage aid for pigmeat(2).</p>
      <p n="12">(4) Under Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2763/75 of 29 October 1975 laying down general rules for granting private storage aid for pigmeat(3), the Commission may decide to reduce or extend the storage period. As well as the amounts of aid for specific periods of storage, the amounts to be added or deducted in the event the Commission adopts such a decision should be fixed.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) In order to facilitate administrative and control work relating to the conclusion of contracts, minimum quantities should be fixed.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) The security should be fixed at a level that will ensure storers fulfil their contractual obligations.</p>
      <p n="15">(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="19">2. Should the Commission extend or reduce the period of storage, the amount of aid shall be adjusted accordingly. The supplements and deductions per month and per day are set out in columns 6 and 7 of the Annex.</p>
      <p n="20">Article 2</p>
      <p n="21">The minimum quantities per contract and per product shall be:</p>
      <p n="22">(a) 10 tonnes for boned products;</p>
      <p n="23">(b) 15 tonnes for other products.</p>
      <p n="24">Article 3</p>

      <p n="26">Article 4</p>
      <p n="27">This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="28">This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
      <p n="29">Done at Brussels, 19 December 2003.</p>
