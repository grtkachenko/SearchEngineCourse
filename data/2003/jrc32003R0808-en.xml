      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 808/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 12 May 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption</p>
      <p n="5">(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
      <p n="6">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal-by-products not intended for human consumption(1), and in particular Articles 12(5) and 32(1) thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="10">(1) The Scientific Steering Committee issued an opinion on 16 and 17 January 2003 on the safety vis-à-vis TSEs of the use of low-capacity incineration plants and co-incineration plants for incinerating potentially TSE infected animal materials.</p>
      <p n="11">(2) In order to take account of that opinion, it is appropriate to amend the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 as regards the operation of low-capacity incineration plants or co-incineration plants for the disposal of the carcasses of certain animals.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) In addition, the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should be amended in order to make a number of technical amendments to them to bring them more into conformity with the Articles of that Regulation and to clarify the rules applicable to a number of additional products.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) Additional rules concerning the treatment of wastewater from premises where microbiological or other contamination risks may be present as a consequence of the handling of Category 1 or Category 2 materials should be provided;</p>
      <p n="14">(5) The material error affecting the technical requirements applicable to the processing of by-products pursuant to the processing Method n° 2 should also be corrected;</p>
      <p n="15">(6) While the feed ban provided for in Council Decision 2000/766/EC(2) remains in force, less stringent processing requirements should apply to mammalian processed animals proteins, given the exclusive destination as waste of such material which is a consequence of the ban;</p>
      <p n="16">(7) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="17">(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
      <p n="18">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

      <p n="24">2. In Article 12(3), the following point (h) is added:</p>
      <p n="25">"(h) fulfil the conditions in Annex IV, Chapter VII when used for the disposal of animal by-products referred to in Article 4(1)(b)."</p>
      <p n="26">3. Annexes I to IX are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
      <p n="27">Article 2</p>

      <p n="185">1. Tricalcium phosphate must be produced by a process hat ensures:</p>
      <p n="186">(a) that all Category 3 bone-material is finely crushed and degreased in counter-flow with hot water (bone chips less than 14 mm);</p>
      <p n="187">(b) grinding of the chips below 1 mm before cooking and continuous cooking with steam at 145 °C during 30 minutes at 4 bars;</p>
