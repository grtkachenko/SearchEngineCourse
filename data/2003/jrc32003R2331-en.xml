      <p n="9">(1) The tariff preferences provided for in Articles 7 and 10 of Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 should be removed in respect of products, originating in a beneficiary country, of a sector which has met, during three consecutive years, either of the criteria laid down in Article 12(1) of that Regulation.</p>
      <p n="10">(2) Tariff preferences which had been removed under previous schemes and under Council Regulation (EC) No 815/2003(2), should be re-established in respect of a sector that has not met, during three consecutive years, the criteria laid down in Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001.</p>

      <p n="12">(4) Tariff preferences which had been removed under previous schemes and under Regulation (EC) No 815/2003, should be re-established in respect of sectors of all beneficiary countries whose exports to the Community account for less than the threshold mentioned in Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001.</p>
      <p n="13">(5) The most recent and complete statistics, which are those for the years 1999 to 2001, should be used in order to establish which sectors meet the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001.</p>
      <p n="14">(6) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 should be replaced in order to reflect the removal or re-establishment of tariff preferences provided for in Articles 7 and 10.</p>
