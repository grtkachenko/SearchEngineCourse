      <p n="2">Decision No 2318/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 5 December 2003</p>
      <p n="4">adopting a multiannual programme (2004 to 2006) for the effective integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and training systems in Europe (eLearning Programme)</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 149(4) and Article 150(4) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Committee for the Regions(2),</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) The objectives of the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci education and training programmes established by Decision No 253/2000/EC(4) and Decision 1999/382/EC(5) respectively include the development of open and distance learning, and the use of information and communication technologies.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) The conclusions of the European Council meeting held in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000 (the Lisbon Council), emphasised the need for adaptation of European education and training systems to the needs of the knowledge economy, and declared the promotion of new basic skills, in particular in information technologies, as one of the three main components of this new approach.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The initiative "eLearning: designing tomorrow's education", launched in May 2000 by the Commission in response to the Lisbon Council was endorsed by the European Council at its meeting in Feira in June 2000. At its meeting in Stockholm in March 2001, the European Council noted the positive results of the initiative.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The "eLearning Action Plan" developed the four action lines of the eLearning initiative (infrastructures and equipment, training, European quality contents and services and cooperation at all levels) in 10 key actions, bringing together the various Community programmes and instruments, for increased coherence and synergy between them and for enhanced accessibility to users.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) On 15 May 2001 the European Parliament adopted a Resolution(6) on both Commission Communications on the subject recognising that the eLearning initiative is helping to strengthen the idea of a "single European educational area", which complements the European research area and the European single market, and calling for it to be developed independently under a new specific programme, with a clear legal basis, avoiding duplication with existing programmes and providing more visibility and added value to Community action.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) The Council Resolution of 13 July 2001 on eLearning(7) endorses this initiative, and calls upon the Commission to continue and to intensify its actions in this field.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) The Commission adopted, on 21 November 2001, the Communication "Making a European area of lifelong learning a reality", indicating the potential of e-learning for making available and managing new educational opportunities to this end.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) The conclusions of the European Council meeting held in Barcelona in March 2002 called for a Europewide school-twinning action and were followed by the Commission Report on school twinnings via Internet, presented to the European Council at its meeting in Seville, as well as an Internet and computer user's certificate for secondary school pupils.</p>
      <p n="20">(9) There is a need to address the problem of social exclusion resulting from the inability of some individuals to take full advantage of the benefits offered by information and communication technologies (ICT) and the Internet in the knowledge society, the so-called "digital divide", which often affects young people, the disabled and elderly, and social categories who are already victims of other forms of exclusion.</p>
      <p n="21">(10) Close attention needs to be paid to the education and in-service training of teachers so that they are able to use the Internet and ICT in the classroom in a critical and educationally responsible manner.</p>
      <p n="22">(11) Close attention should be paid to gender differences in the use of e-learning and the promotion of equal opportunities in this field.</p>
      <p n="23">(12) E-learning has the potential to help the Union respond to the challenges of the knowledge society, to improve the quality of learning, to facilitate access to learning resources, to address special needs, and to bring about more effective and efficient learning and training at the workplace, in particular in small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p n="24">(13) The need for a European dimension in higher education was identified in the Bologna Declaration, signed by 29 European Ministers for Education on 19 June 1999, together with the importance of developing an e-learning dimension in this context.</p>
      <p n="25">(14) The European Union should pay close attention to the effective promotion of virtual higher education campuses to complement activities in mobility programmes within the European Union and with third countries.</p>
      <p n="26">(15) There is a need to reinforce and complement existing instruments and to consider the role of eLearning also in the context of the preparation of the new generation of instruments in the field of education and training.</p>
      <p n="27">(16) In order to reinforce the added value of Community action it is necessary to ensure coherence and complementarity between the actions implemented in the framework of this Decision and other relevant Community policies, instruments and actions, in particular the Information Society Technologies thematic priority of the sixth framework programme for research established by Decision No 1513/2002/EC(8).</p>
      <p n="28">(17) The candidate countries for accession to the European Union and EEA-EFTA States should be able to participate in the eLearning programme. Experts and educational institutions from other third countries should be able to participate in the exchange of experience in the framework of existing cooperation with these third countries.</p>
      <p n="29">(18) The eLearning programme should be regularly monitored and evaluated in cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in order to allow for readjustments, particularly in the priorities for implementing the measures. The evaluation should include an external evaluation to be conducted by independent, impartial bodies.</p>
      <p n="30">(19) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the promotion of European cooperation to improve the quality and accessibility of education and training by an effective use of e-learning, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore by reason of the transnational dimension of the actions and measures necessary be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.</p>
      <p n="31">(20) This Decision lays down for the entire duration of the eLearning programme a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(9), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure.</p>
      <p n="32">(21) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(10),</p>
      <p n="33">HAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
      <p n="34">Article 1</p>
      <p n="35">Establishment of the programme</p>
      <p n="36">1. This Decision establishes the eLearning Programme, a multiannual programme for the improvement of the quality and accessibility of European education and training systems through the effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT), hereinafter referred to as "the programme".</p>
      <p n="37">2. The programme shall be implemented over a period starting on 1 January 2004 and ending on 31 December 2006.</p>

      <p n="134">ANNEX</p>
      <p n="135">1. ACTION LINES</p>
      <p n="136">The action lines are a means to implement the general objective of the programme: to foster the development and appropriate use of e-learning in Europe, and to accompany Member States' efforts in this field. They are structured according to the four areas of intervention of the programme.</p>
      <p n="137">Action line 1: "Promoting digital literacy"</p>
      <p n="138">Action in this field must cover both conceptual and practical issues, from the understanding of digital literacy to identification of remedial actions for specific target groups. Digital literacy is one of the essential skills and competences needed to take an active part in the knowledge society and the new media culture. Digital literacy also relates to media literacy and social competence, as they have in common objectives such as active citizenship and the responsible use of ICTs.</p>
      <p n="139">(a) Identification and dissemination of good practice in the promotion of digital literacy. Particular attention will be paid to improving access to learning resources for those who have no easy access to ICT, to addressing different cognitive and didactic approaches, and different learning styles, to addressing special needs, for example, those of immigrants, hospitalised children or disabled users; and to exploring the use of engaging and motivating approaches.</p>
      <p n="140">(b) Awareness actions via European networks in this field. The programme will support actions carried out by European networks, associations, public authorities, public-private partnerships, etc.; supporting contacts and exchange of good practice between them.</p>
      <p n="141">Action line 2: "European virtual Campuses"</p>
      <p n="142">This action line aims at providing an "e-learning dimension" to European initiatives in the field of higher education, contributing to the creation of a European area of higher education.</p>
      <p n="143">(a) Development of existing instruments in particular those concerning virtual mobility as a complement and reinforcement for physical mobility (virtual Erasmus); recognition and validation schemes (based on ECTS); information and guidance services, and any other synergies between virtual and traditional models. These projects should be based on institutional agreements, whenever possible extending or complementing existing cooperation agreements in the context of the Community mobility programmes.</p>
      <p n="144">(b) Transnational virtual campuses. The programme will support strategic projects to be proposed by higher educational establishments from at least three Member States. Cooperation models for e-learning should be developed regarding: design of joint curricula development by several universities, including agreements for the evaluation, validation and recognition of acquired competences, subject to national procedures; large-scale experiments of virtual mobility in addition to physical mobility; and development of innovative dual mode curricula, based on both traditional and on-line learning methods.</p>
      <p n="145">(c) European e-learning models for higher education. These projects should develop new models for cooperation between European higher education institutions, in particular addressing the provision of continuous training and professional development, and in the development of learning support services as well as for training teachers, trainers and other educational personnel in the pedagogical use of e-learning; examining quality assurance methods; the development of a better understanding of organisational change and possible risks associated with implementing e-learning in higher education; and the development of European models for public-private partnerships in the field of e-learning in higher education, as well as developing the opportunities opened by new partnerships and funding models.</p>
      <p n="146">Action line 3: "E-twinning for primary and secondary schools in Europe and promotion of teachers' training"</p>
      <p n="147">This action line should facilitate school twinnings via the Internet, and promote teachers' training, while stimulating European schools to build pedagogical partnerships with schools elsewhere in Europe, fostering language learning and intercultural dialogue. The action will address primary and secondary schools.</p>
      <p n="148">(a) Identification and analysis of existing initiatives. This action should analyse existing practices. It will identify good demonstration projects on the contribution of educational multimedia and of communication networks for supporting school twinning, especially in the area of multilingual and multicultural projects. It will provide case studies, evaluation materials and methods with a view to helping teachers to exploit the potential of ICT for innovative cooperation methods, such as, for example, virtual classrooms, joint curricula developments for the in-service training of teachers, multidisciplinary approaches or the use of common teaching tools and resources.</p>
      <p n="149">(b) E-twinning support network. This network would be formed by teachers or educators with experience in the area of European cooperation. It will provide pedagogical support and guidance; tools and services for partner search; methods for exchange of experience as well as an Internet hub, based on existing websites, for the twinning action.</p>
      <p n="150">(c) Support for cooperation networks in the field of in-service training of teachers and of other educational personnel. These networks will be based on institutions responsible for the pedagogical use of information and communication technologies. These networks will focus on priority areas of cooperation as outlined in the context of the Report on the concrete and future objectives of the education and training systems. Particular attention will be given to setting up favourable conditions for exploiting the potential of ICT for innovative cooperation methods, for the exchange of educational resources and approaches, and for the joint development of training materials.</p>
      <p n="151">(d) Promotion and communication actions. Success of the initiative depends on a dynamic communication action, anchored in the website, and including, inter alia, design of an attractive visual image, publications, press releases, preparation of fact-sheets on schools projects, launching and closing events, competitions and awards.</p>
      <p n="152">Action line 4: Transversal actions and monitoring of the eLearning Action Plan</p>
      <p n="153">In addition, funding will be given to transversal actions, such as:</p>
      <p n="154">(a) support for active monitoring of the eLearning Action Plan. This action would provide increased coherence and visibility to EU actions on e-learning, via the dissemination of relevant material, such as reports and studies, the clustering of projects addressing similar objectives or using similar methodologies; and support for exchange of experience, networking and any other possible synergies within the Action Plan activities;</p>
      <p n="155">(b) maintenance of an eLearning portal, providing an easy, one-stop access to European activities in the fields of e-learning and to existing information sources, directories, databases, or knowledge repositories; and facilitating user-friendly access to EU programmes, projects, studies, reports and working groups;</p>
      <p n="156">(c) awareness and information actions via European networks. This action would support European networks in the field of e-learning, and relevant activities such as focused conferences, seminars, or workshops on key e-learning themes such as quality assurance; and foster European debate and exchange of good practice in this field;</p>
      <p n="157">(d) design and development of monitoring, analysis and forecasting tools for e-learning in Europe, in cooperation with Eurostat and the European Investment Bank.</p>
      <p n="158">This programme may also contribute to cross-actions with international projects related to good and effective use of ICT for education and training, such as, for example, those under way at the OECD or Unesco.</p>
      <p n="159">Technical support actions</p>
      <p n="160">In addition, the programme execution will be supported by actions aiming at the dissemination of results (e.g. publications, Internet referencing, showcasing projects and events), and transfer, if necessary, by strategic studies addressing emerging problems or opportunities, or any other key issues for e-learning evolution in Europe. The programme will also support continuing feedback by users and participants, and its final external evaluation.</p>
