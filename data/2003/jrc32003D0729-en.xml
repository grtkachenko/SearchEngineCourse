      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>

      <p n="12">(1) Commission Decision 2002/300/EC(3), as last amended by Decision 2003/378/EC(4), lays down the areas in Ireland considered to be free of the diseases Bonamia ostrea and/or Marteilia refringens.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Ireland informed the Commission by letter dated 24 June 2003 of the detection of Bonamia ostrea at the Blacksod Bay on the County Mayo coastline, an area previously considered to be free of that disease. That area can therefore no longer be considered free of Bonamia ostrea.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) Decision 2002/300/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
