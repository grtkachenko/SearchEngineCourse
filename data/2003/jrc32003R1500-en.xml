      <p n="7">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
      <p n="9">Whereas:</p>

      <p n="11">(2) The European Community and the Russian Federation agreed to establish a double-checking system in respect of certain steel products for the period ranging from 13 October 1997 to 31 December 1999. This Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters was approved on behalf of the European Community by means of Decision 97/741/EC(2). The system was extended for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2001 by means of Decision 2000/294/EC(3). Regulation (EC) No 2135/97(4), extended by Regulation (EC) No 793/2000(5), established the corresponding implementing legislation for the Community.</p>
      <p n="12">(3) The situation relating to imports of certain steel products from the Russian Federation to the Community has been the subject of thorough examination and, on the basis of relevant information supplied to them, the Parties have concluded an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters(6) which establishes a double-checking system without quantitative limits for the period between the date of entry into force of this Regulation and 31 December 2004, unless both Parties agree to terminate the system earlier.</p>
      <p n="13">(4) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7),</p>
