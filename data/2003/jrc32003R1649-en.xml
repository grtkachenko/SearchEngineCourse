      <p n="2">Council Regulation (EC) No 1649/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 18 June 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 on the creation of a European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors(3),</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Certain provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975 on the creation of a European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions(4) should be brought into line with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities(5), (hereinafter referred to as the general Financial Regulation), and in particular Article 185 thereof. Pursuant to that Article, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions must adopt financial rules in conformity with Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2343/2002 of 23 December 2002 on the framework Financial Regulation for the bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities(6). Consequently, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1417/76 of 1 June 1976 on the financial provisions applying to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions(7) must be repealed with effect from the entry into force of the financial rules adopted by the Administrative Board of the said Foundation.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) The general principles and limits governing right of access to documents provided for in Article 255 of the Treaty have been laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents(8).</p>
      <p n="13">(3) When Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 was adopted, the three institutions agreed in a joint declaration that the Agencies and similar bodies should implement rules conforming to those of that Regulation.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) Appropriate provisions should therefore be included in Regulation (EC) No 1365/75 to make Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 applicable to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, as should a provision on appeals against a refusal of access to documents.</p>
      <p n="15">(5) Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 should therefore be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="16">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
