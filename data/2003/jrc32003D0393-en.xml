      <p n="8">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>

      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) In accordance with the working plan established by Commission Decision 2002/18/EC(2) the fee structure for the Community eco-label should offer an appropriate incentive to encourage the use of labels under both the Community scheme and other eco-label award schemes.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Commission Decision 2000/728/EC of 10 November 2000 establishing the application and annual fees of the Community eco-label(3) should therefore be amended to allow reductions for products that have also been awarded another eco-label that complies with the general requirements of ISO 14024.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,</p>

      <p n="18">"8a. Competent bodies may grant a reduction of up to 30 % where the product in question has also been awarded another eco-label that complies with the general requirements of ISO 14024."</p>
