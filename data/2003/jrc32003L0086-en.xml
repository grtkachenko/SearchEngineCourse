      <head n="1">Council Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 on the right to family reunification</head>
      <p n="2">Council Directive 2003/86/EC</p>
      <p n="3">of 22 September 2003</p>
      <p n="4">on the right to family reunification</p>
      <p n="5">THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 63(3)(a) thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(3),</p>
      <p n="10">Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(4),</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) With a view to the progressive establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, the Treaty establishing the European Community provides both for the adoption of measures aimed at ensuring the free movement of persons, in conjunction with flanking measures relating to external border controls, asylum and immigration, and for the adoption of measures relating to asylum, immigration and safeguarding the rights of third country nationals.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Measures concerning family reunification should be adopted in conformity with the obligation to protect the family and respect family life enshrined in many instruments of international law. This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular in Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The European Council, at its special meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999, acknowledged the need for harmonisation of national legislation on the conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals. In this context, it has in particular stated that the European Union should ensure fair treatment of third country nationals residing lawfully on the territory of the Member States and that a more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of citizens of the European Union. The European Council accordingly asked the Council rapidly to adopt the legal instruments on the basis of Commission proposals. The need for achieving the objectives defined at Tampere have been reaffirmed by the Laeken European Council on 14 and 15 December 2001.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) Family reunification is a necessary way of making family life possible. It helps to create sociocultural stability facilitating the integration of third country nationals in the Member State, which also serves to promote economic and social cohesion, a fundamental Community objective stated in the Treaty.</p>
      <p n="16">(5) Member States should give effect to the provisions of this Directive without discrimination on the basis of sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic characteristics, language, religion or beliefs, political or other opinions, membership of a national minority, fortune, birth, disabilities, age or sexual orientation.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) To protect the family and establish or preserve family life, the material conditions for exercising the right to family reunification should be determined on the basis of common criteria.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) Member States should be able to apply this Directive also when the family enters together.</p>
      <p n="19">(8) Special attention should be paid to the situation of refugees on account of the reasons which obliged them to flee their country and prevent them from leading a normal family life there. More favourable conditions should therefore be laid down for the exercise of their right to family reunification.</p>
      <p n="20">(9) Family reunification should apply in any case to members of the nuclear family, that is to say the spouse and the minor children.</p>
      <p n="21">(10) It is for the Member States to decide whether they wish to authorise family reunification for relatives in the direct ascending line, adult unmarried children, unmarried or registered partners as well as, in the event of a polygamous marriage, minor children of a further spouse and the sponsor. Where a Member State authorises family reunification of these persons, this is without prejudice of the possibility, for Member States which do not recognise the existence of family ties in the cases covered by this provision, of not granting to the said persons the treatment of family members with regard to the right to reside in another Member State, as defined by the relevant EC legislation.</p>
      <p n="22">(11) The right to family reunification should be exercised in proper compliance with the values and principles recognised by the Member States, in particular with respect to the rights of women and of children; such compliance justifies the possible taking of restrictive measures against applications for family reunification of polygamous households.</p>
      <p n="23">(12) The possibility of limiting the right to family reunification of children over the age of 12, whose primary residence is not with the sponsor, is intended to reflect the children's capacity for integration at early ages and shall ensure that they acquire the necessary education and language skills in school.</p>
      <p n="24">(13) A set of rules governing the procedure for examination of applications for family reunification and for entry and residence of family members should be laid down. Those procedures should be effective and manageable, taking account of the normal workload of the Member States' administrations, as well as transparent and fair, in order to offer appropriate legal certainty to those concerned.</p>
      <p n="25">(14) Family reunification may be refused on duly justified grounds. In particular, the person who wishes to be granted family reunification should not constitute a threat to public policy or public security. The notion of public policy may cover a conviction for committing a serious crime. In this context it has to be noted that the notion of public policy and public security covers also cases in which a third country national belongs to an association which supports terrorism, supports such an association or has extremist aspirations.</p>
      <p n="26">(15) The integration of family members should be promoted. For that purpose, they should be granted a status independent of that of the sponsor, in particular in cases of breakup of marriages and partnerships, and access to education, employment and vocational training on the same terms as the person with whom they are reunited, under the relevant conditions.</p>
      <p n="27">(16) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the establishment of a right to family reunification for third country nationals to be exercised in accordance with common rules, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved by the Community, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.</p>
      <p n="28">(17) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community and without prejudice to Article 4 of the said Protocol these Member States are not participating in the adoption of this Directive and are not bound by or subject to its application.</p>
      <p n="29">(18) In accordance with Article 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Directive, and is not bound by it or subject to its application,</p>
      <p n="30">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="31">CHAPTER I General provisions</p>
      <p n="32">Article 1</p>
      <p n="33">The purpose of this Directive is to determine the conditions for the exercise of the right to family reunification by third country nationals residing lawfully in the territory of the Member States.</p>
      <p n="34">Article 2</p>

      <p n="39">(d) "family reunification" means the entry into and residence in a Member State by family members of a third country national residing lawfully in that Member State in order to preserve the family unit, whether the family relationship arose before or after the resident's entry;</p>
      <p n="40">(e) "residence permit" means any authorisation issued by the authorities of a Member State allowing a third country national to stay legally in its territory, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002 of 13 June 2002 laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third country nationals(5);</p>
      <p n="41">(f) "unaccompanied minor" means third country nationals or stateless persons below the age of eighteen, who arrive on the territory of the Member States unaccompanied by an adult responsible by law or custom, and for as long as they are not effectively taken into the care of such a person, or minors who are left unaccompanied after they entered the territory of the Member States.</p>
      <p n="42">Article 3</p>
      <p n="43">1. This Directive shall apply where the sponsor is holding a residence permit issued by a Member State for a period of validity of one year or more who has reasonable prospects of obtaining the right of permanent residence, if the members of his or her family are third country nationals of whatever status.</p>
      <p n="44">2. This Directive shall not apply where the sponsor is:</p>
      <p n="45">(a) applying for recognition of refugee status whose application has not yet given rise to a final decision;</p>
      <p n="46">(b) authorised to reside in a Member State on the basis of temporary protection or applying for authorisation to reside on that basis and awaiting a decision on his status;</p>
      <p n="47">(c) authorised to reside in a Member State on the basis of a subsidiary form of protection in accordance with international obligations, national legislation or the practice of the Member States or applying for authorisation to reside on that basis and awaiting a decision on his status.</p>
      <p n="48">3. This Directive shall not apply to members of the family of a Union citizen.</p>
      <p n="49">4. This Directive is without prejudice to more favourable provisions of:</p>
      <p n="50">(a) bilateral and multilateral agreements between the Community or the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and third countries, on the other;</p>
      <p n="51">(b) the European Social Charter of 18 October 1961, the amended European Social Charter of 3 May 1987 and the European Convention on the legal status of migrant workers of 24 November 1977.</p>
      <p n="52">5. This Directive shall not affect the possibility for the Member States to adopt or maintain more favourable provisions.</p>
      <p n="53">CHAPTER II Family members</p>
      <p n="54">Article 4</p>
      <p n="55">1. The Member States shall authorise the entry and residence, pursuant to this Directive and subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in Chapter IV, as well as in Article 16, of the following family members:</p>
      <p n="56">(a) the sponsor's spouse;</p>
      <p n="57">(b) the minor children of the sponsor and of his/her spouse, including children adopted in accordance with a decision taken by the competent authority in the Member State concerned or a decision which is automatically enforceable due to international obligations of that Member State or must be recognised in accordance with international obligations;</p>
      <p n="58">(c) the minor children including adopted children of the sponsor where the sponsor has custody and the children are dependent on him or her. Member States may authorise the reunification of children of whom custody is shared, provided the other party sharing custody has given his or her agreement;</p>
      <p n="59">(d) the minor children including adopted children of the spouse where the spouse has custody and the children are dependent on him or her. Member States may authorise the reunification of children of whom custody is shared, provided the other party sharing custody has given his or her agreement.</p>
      <p n="60">The minor children referred to in this Article must be below the age of majority set by the law of the Member State concerned and must not be married.</p>
      <p n="61">By way of derogation, where a child is aged over 12 years and arrives independently from the rest of his/her family, the Member State may, before authorising entry and residence under this Directive, verify whether he or she meets a condition for integration provided for by its existing legislation on the date of implementation of this Directive.</p>
      <p n="62">2. The Member States may, by law or regulation, authorise the entry and residence, pursuant to this Directive and subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in Chapter IV, of the following family members:</p>
      <p n="63">(a) first-degree relatives in the direct ascending line of the sponsor or his or her spouse, where they are dependent on them and do not enjoy proper family support in the country of origin;</p>
      <p n="64">(b) the adult unmarried children of the sponsor or his or her spouse, where they are objectively unable to provide for their own needs on account of their state of health.</p>
      <p n="65">3. The Member States may, by law or regulation, authorise the entry and residence, pursuant to this Directive and subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in Chapter IV, of the unmarried partner, being a third country national, with whom the sponsor is in a duly attested stable long-term relationship, or of a third country national who is bound to the sponsor by a registered partnership in accordance with Article 5(2), and of the unmarried minor children, including adopted children, as well as the adult unmarried children who are objectively unable to provide for their own needs on account of their state of health, of such persons.</p>
      <p n="66">Member States may decide that registered partners are to be treated equally as spouses with respect to family reunification.</p>
      <p n="67">4. In the event of a polygamous marriage, where the sponsor already has a spouse living with him in the territory of a Member State, the Member State concerned shall not authorise the family reunification of a further spouse.</p>
      <p n="68">By way of derogation from paragraph 1(c), Member States may limit the family reunification of minor children of a further spouse and the sponsor.</p>
      <p n="69">5. In order to ensure better integration and to prevent forced marriages Member States may require the sponsor and his/her spouse to be of a minimum age, and at maximum 21 years, before the spouse is able to join him/her.</p>
      <p n="70">6. By way of derogation, Member States may request that the applications concerning family reunification of minor children have to be submitted before the age of 15, as provided for by its existing legislation on the date of the implementation of this Directive. If the application is submitted after the age of 15, the Member States which decide to apply this derogation shall authorise the entry and residence of such children on grounds other than family reunification.</p>
      <p n="71">CHAPTER III Submission and examination of the application</p>
      <p n="72">Article 5</p>
      <p n="73">1. Member States shall determine whether, in order to exercise the right to family reunification, an application for entry and residence shall be submitted to the competent authorities of the Member State concerned either by the sponsor or by the family member or members.</p>
      <p n="74">2. The application shall be accompanied by documentary evidence of the family relationship and of compliance with the conditions laid down in Articles 4 and 6 and, where applicable, Articles 7 and 8, as well as certified copies of family member(s)' travel documents.</p>
      <p n="75">If appropriate, in order to obtain evidence that a family relationship exists, Member States may carry out interviews with the sponsor and his/her family members and conduct other investigations that are found to be necessary.</p>
      <p n="76">When examining an application concerning the unmarried partner of the sponsor, Member States shall consider, as evidence of the family relationship, factors such as a common child, previous cohabitation, registration of the partnership and any other reliable means of proof.</p>
      <p n="77">3. The application shall be submitted and examined when the family members are residing outside the territory of the Member State in which the sponsor resides.</p>
      <p n="78">By way of derogation, a Member State may, in appropriate circumstances, accept an application submitted when the family members are already in its territory.</p>
      <p n="79">4. The competent authorities of the Member State shall give the person, who has submitted the application, written notification of the decision as soon as possible and in any event no later than nine months from the date on which the application was lodged.</p>
      <p n="80">In exceptional circumstances linked to the complexity of the examination of the application, the time limit referred to in the first subparagraph may be extended.</p>
      <p n="81">Reasons shall be given for the decision rejecting the application. Any consequences of no decision being taken by the end of the period provided for in the first subparagraph shall be determined by the national legislation of the relevant Member State.</p>
      <p n="82">5. When examining an application, the Member States shall have due regard to the best interests of minor children.</p>
      <p n="83">CHAPTER IV Requirements for the exercise of the right to family reunification</p>
      <p n="84">Article 6</p>
      <p n="85">1. The Member States may reject an application for entry and residence of family members on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.</p>
      <p n="86">2. Member States may withdraw or refuse to renew a family member's residence permit on grounds of public policy or public security or public health.</p>
      <p n="87">When taking the relevant decision, the Member State shall consider, besides Article 17, the severity or type of offence against public policy or public security committed by the family member, or the dangers that are emanating from such person.</p>
      <p n="88">3. Renewal of the residence permit may not be withheld and removal from the territory may not be ordered by the competent authority of the Member State concerned on the sole ground of illness or disability suffered after the issue of the residence permit.</p>
      <p n="89">Article 7</p>
      <p n="90">1. When the application for family reunification is submitted, the Member State concerned may require the person who has submitted the application to provide evidence that the sponsor has:</p>
      <p n="91">(a) accommodation regarded as normal for a comparable family in the same region and which meets the general health and safety standards in force in the Member State concerned;</p>
      <p n="92">(b) sickness insurance in respect of all risks normally covered for its own nationals in the Member State concerned for himself/herself and the members of his/her family;</p>
      <p n="93">(c) stable and regular resources which are sufficient to maintain himself/herself and the members of his/her family, without recourse to the social assistance system of the Member State concerned. Member States shall evaluate these resources by reference to their nature and regularity and may take into account the level of minimum national wages and pensions as well as the number of family members.</p>
      <p n="94">2. Member States may require third country nationals to comply with integration measures, in accordance with national law.</p>
      <p n="95">With regard to the refugees and/or family members of refugees referred to in Article 12 the integration measures referred to in the first subparagraph may only be applied once the persons concerned have been granted family reunification.</p>
      <p n="96">Article 8</p>
      <p n="97">Member States may require the sponsor to have stayed lawfully in their territory for a period not exceeding two years, before having his/her family members join him/her.</p>
      <p n="98">By way of derogation, where the legislation of a Member State relating to family reunification in force on the date of adoption of this Directive takes into account its reception capacity, the Member State may provide for a waiting period of no more than three years between submission of the application for family reunification and the issue of a residence permit to the family members.</p>
      <p n="99">CHAPTER V Family reunification of refugees</p>
      <p n="100">Article 9</p>
      <p n="101">1. This Chapter shall apply to family reunification of refugees recognised by the Member States.</p>
      <p n="102">2. Member States may confine the application of this Chapter to refugees whose family relationships predate their entry.</p>
      <p n="103">3. This Chapter is without prejudice to any rules granting refugee status to family members.</p>
      <p n="104">Article 10</p>
      <p n="105">1. Article 4 shall apply to the definition of family members except that the third subparagraph of paragraph 1 thereof shall not apply to the children of refugees.</p>
      <p n="106">2. The Member States may authorise family reunification of other family members not referred to in Article 4, if they are dependent on the refugee.</p>
      <p n="107">3. If the refugee is an unaccompanied minor, the Member States:</p>
      <p n="108">(a) shall authorise the entry and residence for the purposes of family reunification of his/her first-degree relatives in the direct ascending line without applying the conditions laid down in Article 4(2)(a);</p>
      <p n="109">(b) may authorise the entry and residence for the purposes of family reunification of his/her legal guardian or any other member of the family, where the refugee has no relatives in the direct ascending line or such relatives cannot be traced.</p>
      <p n="110">Article 11</p>
      <p n="111">1. Article 5 shall apply to the submission and examination of the application, subject to paragraph 2 of this Article.</p>
      <p n="112">2. Where a refugee cannot provide official documentary evidence of the family relationship, the Member States shall take into account other evidence, to be assessed in accordance with national law, of the existence of such relationship. A decision rejecting an application may not be based solely on the fact that documentary evidence is lacking.</p>
      <p n="113">Article 12</p>
      <p n="114">1. By way of derogation from Article 7, the Member States shall not require the refugee and/or family member(s) to provide, in respect of applications concerning those family members referred to in Article 4(1), the evidence that the refugee fulfils the requirements set out in Article 7.</p>
      <p n="115">Without prejudice to international obligations, where family reunification is possible in a third country with which the sponsor and/or family member has special links, Member States may require provision of the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph.</p>
      <p n="116">Member States may require the refugee to meet the conditions referred to in Article 7(1) if the application for family reunification is not submitted within a period of three months after the granting of the refugee status.</p>
      <p n="117">2. By way of derogation from Article 8, the Member States shall not require the refugee to have resided in their territory for a certain period of time, before having his/her family members join him/her.</p>
      <p n="118">CHAPTER VI Entry and residence of family members</p>
      <p n="119">Article 13</p>
      <p n="120">1. As soon as the application for family reunification has been accepted, the Member State concerned shall authorise the entry of the family member or members. In that regard, the Member State concerned shall grant such persons every facility for obtaining the requisite visas.</p>
      <p n="121">2. The Member State concerned shall grant the family members a first residence permit of at least one year's duration. This residence permit shall be renewable.</p>
      <p n="122">3. The duration of the residence permits granted to the family member(s) shall in principle not go beyond the date of expiry of the residence permit held by the sponsor.</p>
      <p n="123">Article 14</p>
      <p n="124">1. The sponsor's family members shall be entitled, in the same way as the sponsor, to:</p>
      <p n="125">(a) access to education;</p>
      <p n="126">(b) access to employment and self-employed activity;</p>
      <p n="127">(c) access to vocational guidance, initial and further training and retraining.</p>
      <p n="128">2. Member States may decide according to national law the conditions under which family members shall exercise an employed or self-employed activity. These conditions shall set a time limit which shall in no case exceed 12 months, during which Member States may examine the situation of their labour market before authorising family members to exercise an employed or self-employed activity.</p>
      <p n="129">3. Member States may restrict access to employment or self-employed activity by first-degree relatives in the direct ascending line or adult unmarried children to whom Article 4(2) applies.</p>
      <p n="130">Article 15</p>
      <p n="131">1. Not later than after five years of residence, and provided that the family member has not been granted a residence permit for reasons other than family reunification, the spouse or unmarried partner and a child who has reached majority shall be entitled, upon application, if required, to an autonomous residence permit, independent of that of the sponsor.</p>
      <p n="132">Member States may limit the granting of the residence permit referred to in the first subparagraph to the spouse or unmarried partner in cases of breakdown of the family relationship.</p>
      <p n="133">2. The Member States may issue an autonomous residence permit to adult children and to relatives in the direct ascending line to whom Article 4(2) applies.</p>
      <p n="134">3. In the event of widowhood, divorce, separation, or death of first-degree relatives in the direct ascending or descending line, an autonomous residence permit may be issued, upon application, if required, to persons who have entered by virtue of family reunification. Member States shall lay down provisions ensuring the granting of an autonomous residence permit in the event of particularly difficult circumstances.</p>
      <p n="135">4. The conditions relating to the granting and duration of the autonomous residence permit are established by national law.</p>
      <p n="136">CHAPTER VII Penalties and redress</p>
      <p n="137">Article 16</p>
      <p n="138">1. Member States may reject an application for entry and residence for the purpose of family reunification, or, if appropriate, withdraw or refuse to renew a family member's residence permit, in the following circumstances:</p>
      <p n="139">(a) where the conditions laid down by this Directive are not or are no longer satisfied.</p>
      <p n="140">When renewing the residence permit, where the sponsor has not sufficient resources without recourse to the social assistance system of the Member State, as referred to in Article 7(1)(c), the Member State shall take into account the contributions of the family members to the household income;</p>
