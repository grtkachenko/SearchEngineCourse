      <p n="23">The annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial perspective.";</p>
      <p n="24">3. in Article 6, "31 July 2003" shall be replaced by "31 July 2007";</p>
      <p n="25">4. in Article 7, "31 December 2003" shall be replaced by "31 December 2007".</p>
