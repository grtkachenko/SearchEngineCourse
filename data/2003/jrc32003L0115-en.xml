      <head n="1">Directive 2003/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 December 2003 amending Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs</head>
      <p n="2">Directive 2003/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
      <p n="3">of 22 December 2003</p>
      <p n="4">amending Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs</p>
      <p n="5">THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
      <p n="9">After consultation of the Scientific Committee on Food, pursuant to Article 6 of Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption(3),</p>
      <p n="10">Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),</p>
      <p n="11">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="12">(1) Directive 94/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1994 on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs(5) lays down a list of sweeteners that may be used in the Community and their conditions of use.</p>
      <p n="13">(2) Since 1996, two new sweeteners, sucralose and the salt of aspartame and acesulfame, have been found acceptable for use in food by the Scientific Committee on Food.</p>
      <p n="14">(3) The opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on cyclamic acid and its sodium and calcium salts (which led to the establishment of a new acceptable daily intake (ADI)) and recent studies on the intake of cyclamates lead to a reduction of the maximum usable doses of cyclamic acid and its sodium and calcium salts.</p>
      <p n="15">(4) The designation of certain food categories in Directive 94/35/EC should be adapted to take into account Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements(6) and of specific directives adopted for some groups of foodstuffs listed in Annex I to Council Directive 89/398/EEC(7).</p>
      <p n="16">(5) The use of the food additives concerned complies with the general criteria laid down in Annex II to Directive 89/107/EEC.</p>
      <p n="17">(6) Articles 53 and 54 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(8) establish procedures for taking emergency measures in relation to food of Community origin or imported from a third country. They allow the Commission to adopt such measures in situations where food is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment and where such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned.</p>
      <p n="18">(7) The measures necessary for implementation of Directive 94/35/EC should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(9).</p>
      <p n="19">(8) Directive 94/35/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,</p>
      <p n="20">HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
      <p n="21">Article 1</p>
      <p n="22">Directive 94/35/EC is hereby amended as follows:</p>
      <p n="23">1. Article 4 shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="24">"Article 4</p>
      <p n="25">It may be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 7:</p>
      <p n="26">- where there are differences of opinion as to whether sweeteners can be used in a given foodstuff under the terms of this Directive, whether that foodstuff is to be considered as belonging to one of the categories listed in the third column of the Annex, and</p>
      <p n="27">- whether a food additive listed in the Annex and authorised at 'quantum satis' is used in accordance with the criteria referred to in Article 2.";</p>
      <p n="28">2. a third indent shall be added to Article 5(2):</p>
      <p n="29">"- salt of aspartame and acesulfame: 'contains a source of phenylalanine'.";</p>
      <p n="30">3. Article 7 shall be replaced by the following:</p>
      <p n="31">"Article 7</p>
      <p n="32">1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health set up pursuant to Article 58 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002(10), hereinafter referred to as 'the Committee'.</p>
      <p n="33">2. Where reference is made to this Article, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC(11) shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.</p>
      <p n="34">The period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.</p>
      <p n="35">3. The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure."</p>

      <p n="37">Article 2</p>

These re-evaluations shall be carried out on the basis of consumer data supplied by the Member States and shall take account of the effects of additives on vulnerable population groups.</p>
      <p n="39">Article 3</p>
      <p n="40">Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive in order to:</p>
      <p n="41">- authorise trade in and use of products conforming with this Directive by 29 January 2005 at the latest,</p>
      <p n="42">- prohibit trade in and use of products not conforming with this Directive by 29 July 2005 at the latest; however, products placed on the market before that date which do not comply with this Directive may be marketed until 29 January 2006.</p>
      <p n="43">They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
      <p n="44">When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.</p>
      <p n="45">Article 4</p>
      <p n="46">This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p n="47">Article 5</p>
