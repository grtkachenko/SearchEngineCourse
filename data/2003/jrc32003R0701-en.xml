      <p n="2">Commission Regulation (EC) No 701/2003</p>
      <p n="3">of 16 April 2003</p>
      <p n="4">laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2286/2002 as regards the arrangements applicable to imports of certain poultrymeat and egg products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States)</p>
      <p n="5">THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
      <p n="6">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
      <p n="7">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in eggs(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 493/2002(2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,</p>
      <p n="8">Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 493/2002, and in particular Article 3 thereof,</p>
      <p n="9">Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2286/2002 of 10 December 2002 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1706/98(4), and in particular Article 5 thereof,</p>
      <p n="10">Whereas:</p>
      <p n="11">(1) Regulation (EC) No 2286/2002 implements the amendments to the arrangements for imports from the ACP States made as a result of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000(5). Article 1(3) of that Regulation introduces general arrangements for reducing customs duties for the products in Annex I thereto and specific arrangements for reducing customs duties, within the framework of the tariff quotas, for certain products in Annex II thereto.</p>
      <p n="12">(2) As a result of these new import arrangements, detailed rules of application should be laid down for the issue of import licences for products qualifying for reduced duties. Commission Regulation (EC) No 704/1999 of 31 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of the arrangements for imports of eggs and poultrymeat products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 903/90(6), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1043/2001(7), should therefore be repealed.</p>
      <p n="13">(3) For the purposes of managing the tariff import quotas, the general rules laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(9), should be applied where this Regulation does not lay down specific rules.</p>
      <p n="14">(4) In order to ensure proper administration of the quotas, a security should be required for applications for import licences and certain conditions should be laid down as regards applicants themselves. The quotas should also be staggered over the year and the term of validity of licences should be specified.</p>
      <p n="15">(5) To allow optimum management of the tariff quota, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2003.</p>
      <p n="16">(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,</p>
      <p n="17">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
      <p n="18">Article 1</p>
      <p n="19">All imports into the Community under Regulation (EC) No 2286/2002 of products covered by CN codes listed in Annex I to this Regulation shall qualify for reduced customs duties on presentation of an import licence.</p>
      <p n="20">Licences shall be issued under the conditions laid down in this Regulation and within the limit of the quotas laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2286/2002.</p>
      <p n="21">Article 2</p>
      <p n="22">The annual tariff quota referred to in Part B of Annex I shall be staggered as follows:</p>
      <p n="23">- 50 % in the period 1 January to 30 June,</p>
      <p n="24">- 50 % in the period 1 July to 31 December.</p>
      <p n="25">Article 3</p>
      <p n="26">1.

      <p n="27">However, retail establishments or restaurants selling their products to final consumers shall be excluded from the reduction in customs duties.</p>
      <p n="28">2. Import licence applications may mention only one of the quota numbers referred to in Annex I. They may involve several products covered by different CN codes. In such cases, all the CN codes shall be indicated in box 16 and their description in box 15 of licence applications and licences.</p>
