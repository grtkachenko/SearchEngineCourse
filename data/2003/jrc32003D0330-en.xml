      <p n="11">(3) Document SCH/II-Vision (99) 5 was subsequently amended by Council Decisions of 24 April 2001 and of 19 December 2002, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 of 24 April 2001 reserving to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for examining visa applications(2).</p>

      <p n="13">(5) It is appropriate to repeal Article 2 of Decision 2000/645/EC, so that future decisions on the classification of the Schengen consultation network (technical specifications) may be taken in accordance with the normal rules on the classification of documents, as set out in Council Decision 2001/264/EC of 19 March 2001 adopting the Council's security regulations(3),</p>

      <p n="22">Article 4</p>
      <p n="23">This Decision shall take effect on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
